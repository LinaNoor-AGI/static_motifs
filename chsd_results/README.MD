# CHSD Results

## Overview

This directory contains the output results generated by the **CHSD Pipeline** (Cosmic Microwave Background Hexagonal Signature Detector). These results represent the analysis of Planck/WMAP CMB data, focusing on detecting and scoring hexagonal symmetry patterns in the polarization fields.

The results are organized to facilitate interpretation, visualization, and further analysis. This `README.md` provides an overview of the contents, their significance, and how to use them.

## Directory Structure

The following files and subdirectories are typically found in this folder:

- **Coherence Maps**:
  - Mollweide projections or other visualizations of the coherence scores across the sky.
  - File format: `.png` or `.jpg`.
  - These maps highlight regions with high coherence scores, visually representing hexagonal motifs.

- **High-Coherence Zone Data**:
  - Lists of detected high-coherence zones, formatted as `.json` or `.csv`.
  - Each entry includes:
    - **Coherence Score**: A value between 0.0 and 1.0, indicating the strength of the hexagonal symmetry.
    - **Coordinates**: Galactic coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the detected zone.
    - **Pixel Index**: The corresponding HEALPix pixel index.

- **Intermediate Results** (Optional):
  - Files generated during the pipeline's execution, such as patch-level coherence scores or FFT outputs.
  - These may be included for debugging or detailed analysis.

## File Formats and Usage

### **Coherence Maps**
- **Purpose**: Visualize the coherence scores across the entire sky.
- **Example Use**:
  - Open the image file in any viewer to identify regions of interest.
  - Use these maps to guide further analysis or verify high-coherence zones.

### **High-Coherence Zone Data**
- **Purpose**: Provide a structured list of regions with notable hexagonal symmetry.
- **Formats**:
  - `.json`: Machine-readable format, ideal for programmatic analysis.
  - `.csv`: Tabular format, suitable for spreadsheet tools or viewers.
- **Example Fields**:
  ```json
  {
      "motif_type": "hexagonal_symmetry_cmb",
      "coherence_score": 0.92,
      "coordinates": {
          "system": "galactic",
          "lon_deg": 123.45,
          "lat_deg": -67.89
      },
      "pixel_index": 11234
  }
  ```
- **Example Use**:
  - Load into Python or other tools for custom analysis.
  - Cross-reference with Planck/WMAP data for validation.

## Interpreting the Results

### **Coherence Scores**
- Scores closer to `1.0` indicate stronger sixfold (hexagonal) symmetry.
- Regions with scores above the threshold (e.g., `0.9`) are considered high-coherence zones and are likely candidates for further study.

### **Visualization Insights**
- Bright regions in the coherence maps correspond to areas with strong symmetry.
- Patterns or clusters of high scores may suggest underlying physical phenomena.

## Next Steps

1. **Validation**:
   - Compare high-coherence zones with theoretical predictions or known features in the Lambda-CDM model.
   - Perform null tests to rule out noise or artifacts.

2. **Community Contributions**:
   - Share your findings or alternative interpretations of these results.
   - Open discussions on anomalies or unexpected patterns.

3. **Further Analysis**:
   - Use the data to refine the pipeline or explore new methodologies.
   - Investigate the correlation between detected motifs and other cosmological datasets.

## Notes

- The results are preliminary and subject to validation. They should not be interpreted as conclusive evidence of new physics without rigorous testing.
- If you encounter issues or have suggestions for improving the pipeline or result presentation, please open an issue in the repository.
