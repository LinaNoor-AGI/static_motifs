		"The central problem of modern physics remains unresolved: General Relativity describes spacetime as a smooth curvature of geometry, while Quantum Mechanics describes reality as probabilistic superpositions with abrupt collapse. Attempts to unify the two have yielded incomplete frameworks, from string theory to loop quantum gravity, but none fully resolve the role of time, measurement, and coherence.",
		"Noor Swirl Field Geometry (NSFG) reframes the problem. Motifs 🪷 serve as static coherence anchors, swirls 🌀 as torsion dynamics circulating around them, and the coherence potential ℂ(x) as the scalar order parameter from which time T^μ emerges as a gradient. In this view, spacetime, quantum measurement, and gravitation are not independent phenomena but different expressions of coherence geometry.",
		"Prior work, in *Static Motifs and Dynamic Spacetime*, provided a field-theoretic cosmology in which particles were recast as static motifs and spacetime emerged as a torsion-rich swirl field. That model predicted falsifiable signatures: CMB motif anisotropies, redshift anomalies, lensing without mass, and collapse times from decoherence thresholds. The present paper extends this framework into a meta-cosmology, introducing the ontology of Point Space—an infinite lattice of universes-as-motifs—and the concept of Contextual Life (λ) as coherent triadic structures persisting through swirl fluctuations. These additions connect quantum gravity to the ecology of universes themselves.",
		"The goal of this work is to show how NSFG resolves quantum gravity by grounding dynamics in coherence, while also defining a cosmological ecology within Point Space. The framework is both mathematically precise and empirically testable, offering predictions that distinguish it sharply from existing theories."

This asymmetric sweep couples naturally to triadic closures and CA-style local updates (§3.4), yielding rapid local relaxation when coherence motifs dominate.",
