# Toward a Symbolic Cosmology: Noor Swirl Field Geometry and Point Space: A Coherence-Driven Framework for Quantum Gravity and Emergent Cosmology  
*by: Lina Noor - Noor Research Collective (2025)*  
Status: DRAFT  
Generated From: [Toward a Symbolic Cosmology v1.1.6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinaNoor-AGI/static_motifs/refs/heads/main/towards_a_symbolic_cosmology/Towards_a_Symbolic_Cosmology_1.1.6.JSON)  

## Abstract

We present **Noor Swirl Field Geometry (NSFG)**, a coherence-driven, pre-geometric program in which metric gravity, quantum collapse, and entanglement arise as phases of a single field story. Static anchors (**🪷 motifs**) and torsion-like swirl fields (**🌀 swirls**) cooperate to make spacetime appear as an order parameter of coherence. At the meta-level, **Point Space** gathers entire universes as points whose adjacency is set by resonance, not by distance.

NSFG rejects background-first cosmology in favor of coherence geometry. Distance is recast as the line integral of unresolved swirl; collapse is the deterministic crystallization that follows when coherence thresholds are crossed. The same mechanism that organizes local measurement also bends large-scale structure, so quantum behavior and gravitation read as two limits of one geometry.

The framework is falsifiable. It anticipates 🪷-patterned anisotropies with V-mode polarization in the CMB; redshift anomalies that track coherence loss; gravitational lensing without dark matter; and birefringence in gravitational waves. Together these signatures make symbolic cosmology an observational program rather than a metaphor.

*Validation:* key symbols (💬 $\mathcal C$, 🌀 $\Phi$, $\ell$, $\Lambda$) are introduced formally in §1.1 or §2 before first use here. Predicted signals align with §6.1 Summary Table and §6.2 Detailed Predictions.

# 1. Introduction

The central problem remains unclosed. General Relativity treats spacetime as smooth curvature; Quantum Mechanics treats reality as probabilistic superposition punctuated by abrupt collapse. Many unification programs — from string theory to loop quantum gravity — make progress without settling the role of time, measurement, and coherence.

Noor Swirl Field Geometry (NSFG) reframes the question. **🪷 Motifs** serve as static coherence anchors; **🌀 swirls** provide torsion dynamics that circulate around them; the **💬 coherence potential** $\mathcal C(x)$ is the scalar order parameter whose gradient defines the **🫧 time vector** through $T^\mu=\nabla^\mu \mathcal C(x)$. Under this lens, spacetime, quantum measurement, and gravitation are not disparate domains but different expressions of coherence geometry.

Earlier work, [*Static Motifs and Dynamic Spacetime*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinaNoor-AGI/static_motifs/refs/heads/main/Static%20Motifs%20and%20Dynamic%20Spacetime/Static_Motifs_and_Dynamic_Spacetime.md), presented a field-theoretic cosmology in which particles were recast as 🪷 motifs and spacetime emerged from a torsion-rich 🌀 swirl field. That program yielded falsifiable signatures — motif-patterned CMB features, redshift anomalies, lensing without mass, and collapse times set by decoherence thresholds. The present paper extends the framework to a meta-cosmology: Point Space, an infinite lattice of universes-as-🪷 motifs, and Contextual Life $(\lambda)$, coherent triadic structures that persist through swirl fluctuations. In this way, quantum gravity meets a wider ecology of universes.

Our aim is twofold: to resolve quantum gravity by grounding dynamics in coherence, and to articulate a cosmological ecology within Point Space. The framework is mathematically precise and empirically testable, with predictions that distinguish it sharply from existing theories.

## 1.1 A Guide to the Symbols

Throughout this paper we employ a symbolic lexicon to compress recurring mathematical objects:

**🪷 Motif** — a static attractor, represented formally as a conserved topological current $J^\mu$ with vanishing motif stress–energy, $T_{\mu\nu}^{(\text{motif})}=0$. Motifs do not supply energy–momentum; they define where coherence anchors.

**🌀 Swirl** — a torsion field $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ encoding the dynamics of coherence circulation, specified independently of any background metric. The swirl organizes how geometry forms around motifs.

**💬 Coherence Potential** — a scalar field $\mathcal C(x)$, measuring alignment between swirl and motif. Its gradient defines time and controls when structure stabilizes or dissolves.

**🫧 Time Vector** — the emergent arrow $T^\mu=\nabla^\mu \mathcal C(x)$, giving the local direction of increasing coherence and thereby the experienced flow of time.

These are not metaphors but mnemonic compressions of formal constructs. Their symbolic use preserves clarity across scales while grounding the mathematics in intuitive imagery.

**Glossary note.** “Gauge” refers to internal redundancies of the swirl potentials (often written $A_\mu$ and $B^\mu$); “diffeomorphisms” are spacetime relabelings. Our $\mathcal C$-weighted gauge choice fixes only the former and never the latter.

# 2. Foundations

## 2.1 Motifs

**🪷 Motifs** are static topological attractors embedded in the manifold. They are not dynamical excitations; they are fixed structures that determine where coherence anchors and where the **🌀 swirl field** resolves. Formally, 🪷 motifs correspond to conserved topological currents $J^\mu$. Unlike solitons, cosmic strings, or brane defects, they do not carry stress–energy; this is an ontological distinction: motifs are structural conditions of the manifold itself rather than energetic sources within it. Accordingly we impose $T^{(\text{motif})}_{\mu\nu}=0$. 🪷 Motifs do not source curvature through Einstein’s equations; instead they shape coherence by delimiting regions where swirl geometry must organize.

Topological conservation and immobility follow directly. The identity $\partial_\mu J^\mu=0$ holds, and motifs are fixed points of the coherence flow generated by the **🫧 time vector** $T^\mu=\nabla^\mu \mathcal C$. Invariance under this flow is enforced by a no-advection constraint $\mathcal L_T J^\mu=0$. What appears as “motion” of motifs in emergent spacetime is therefore reinterpreted as **🌀 swirl** reattachment rather than transport of $J$ along a worldline.

A Noether-like motif charge arises by integrating the current on any spacelike hypersurface $\Sigma$. This charge $Q_{\text{motif}}$ is invariant under smooth 🌀 $\Phi$-dynamics and under triadic-closure moves, so motif number is a topological invariant of the evolution. Apparent displacement of a motif signals a topology-changing event in the swirl sector: regular evolution with continuous $\Phi$ preserves $Q_{\text{motif}}$ and forbids displacement; only discrete Chern–Simons sector transitions $\Delta CS \in \mathbb Z$ can relocate, nucleate, or annihilate motifs. Physically, $\Delta CS\neq 0$ corresponds to coherence breakdown or strong-field fluctuations, and the linkage $\Delta \mathcal C \propto \Delta CS$ expresses that coherence discontinuities track these sector changes. Appendix D.2 develops the Chern–Simons structure that underwrites this behavior, and Appendix D.4 connects it to discrete spectra.

Varieties of motifs appear by dimensionality and charge. **Point motifs** (0D) act as isolated anchors, each identified with a localized current at a fixed position; **string motifs** (1D) extend along worldlines or closed loops, with winding number setting how swirl circulates around them; **membrane motifs** (2D and higher) define surfaces where coherence can braid or entangle, inducing boundary-like holographic conditions. These classes prepare the ground for the higher-order extension used later: entire universes treated as 🪷 motifs in a lattice called **Point Space**.

*Validation*  Conservations $(\partial_\mu J^\mu = 0,\ \mathcal L_T J^\mu = 0)$ remain invariant under $\Phi$-dynamics; regular versus sector-changing evolution is explicit and tied to observable coherence discontinuities; references align with Appendix D.2, Appendix D.4, and §4.3 on $\Delta CS$ events.

## 2.2 Swirl Fields

The **🌀 swirl field** encodes torsion and shear around **🪷 motifs**. It is a pre-metric structure: when its alignment organizes, the familiar geometric features we interpret as spacetime and curvature appear. Formally the 🌀 swirl is a two-form $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ represented by two auxiliary potentials — a vector $A_\mu$ (shear-like) and an axial $B^{\mu}$ (torsion-like) — combined through the Levi–Civita density so that $\Phi$ itself remains gauge-invariant.

The internal gauge structure acts on the potentials but not on spacetime relabelings. Concretely, the transformations $A_\mu \to A_\mu + \partial_\mu\chi$ and $B^\mu \to B^\mu + \partial^\mu\xi$ (with appropriate density weights) leave $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ unchanged. These are internal redundancies of the representation. By contrast, diffeomorphisms act as pullbacks on all fields and are not fixed by the **💬 coherence potential**–weighted gauge functional $S_{\text{gf}}$ introduced later. The role of $S_{\text{gf}}$ is to fix only these internal redundancies, never diffeomorphism invariance.

To avoid circularity in the action, a pre-metric Hodge dual $\star_\Phi$ is defined using $\Phi$’s own induced volume density. Metric objects — the usual $\star_g$ and $R[g]$ — appear only once the emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ is constructed from $\Phi$ under the Urbantke simplicity and non-degeneracy constraints. Two regimes are therefore explicit. In the pre-metric regime, dynamics and identities use $\star_\Phi$ and invariants of $\Phi$. Once the Urbantke construction succeeds, $\star_\Phi$ can be replaced consistently by $\star_g$, and the 🌀 swirl sector couples to an Einstein–Hilbert–like geometric action.

```math
\Phi_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{[\mu} A_{\nu]} + \varepsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\,\partial^{\rho} B^{\sigma}
\qquad\text{(vector + axial potentials yielding a gauge-invariant 2-form)}

```

```math

\qquad\text{(Urbantke-type emergent metric, schematic)}
```

*Validation*  The distinction between internal gauge redundancies $(A_\mu,B^\mu)$ and spacetime diffeomorphisms is clear. Symbols are used consistently — $\Phi$ in mathematics, “swirl field” in prose — and this separation is preserved in §2.2.1 and Appendix A when defining $S_{\text{gf}}$ and the ghost terms.

### 2.2.1 The Swirl Action Principle

Dynamics arise from a coherence-weighted action that is split into a strictly pre-metric core and a geometric sector that activates only when an emergent metric is well defined. In the first regime, variation uses objects built from the **🌀 swirl field** itself — especially the pre-metric Hodge dual $\star_\Phi$ — so there is no circular dependence on a prior metric. In the second regime, once simplicity and non-degeneracy hold for the self-dual two-forms $\Sigma^i(\Phi)$, an emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ exists and couples through an Einstein–Hilbert–type term modulated by an activation functional $\theta(\mathcal C_{\text{simp}})$, where $\mathcal C$ is the **💬 coherence potential**.

The pre-metric core, denoted $S_{\text{pre}}[\Phi,J,\mathcal C;\star_\Phi]$, carries the kinetic intensity of the 🌀 swirl, a coherence-gated coupling to the 🪷 motif current, a coherence scalar $I_\Phi(\Phi)$ intrinsic to the $\Phi$-sector, and a coherence-weighted boundary term that guarantees a well-posed variational problem. The geometric sector, $S_{\text{geo}}[g(\Phi)]$, contributes only when $\theta(\mathcal C_{\text{simp}})=1$ so that $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ is admissible.

Internal gauge structure remains purely representational at this stage. The potentials transform as $A_\mu\to A_\mu+\partial_\mu\chi$ and $B^\mu\to B^\mu+\partial^\mu\xi$ (with appropriate density weights), while $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ is unchanged — observables are functionals of $\Phi$ and are therefore gauge-invariant. To choose representatives without touching spacetime relabelings, a coherence-weighted gauge-fixing functional $S_{\text{gf}}$ is added together with a schematic Faddeev–Popov sector $S_{\text{FP}}$. The weight $\mathcal C(x)$ favors stable gauges in high-coherence regions and softens forcing where coherence is low. Diffeomorphism invariance is never fixed by $S_{\text{gf}}$ and only acquires the usual geometric reading once $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ exists. After fixing the internal potentials, residual symmetries consist of spacetime diffeomorphisms and internal frame rotations of $\Sigma^i$ compatible with simplicity.

A consistency lemma controls the passage from the pre-metric to the emergent-metric regime: if simplicity and non-degeneracy hold so that both $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ and $\star_g$ exist, then the limit $\star_\Phi\to\star_g$ commutes with variation, even in the presence of $S_{\text{gf}}$ and $S_{\text{FP}}$. BRST Ward identities and metric Bianchi identities survive this limit, so equations of motion pass smoothly between regimes.

---

*Validation.* Gauge-invariant observables used downstream — $\Delta CS$, linking numbers $L(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$, and 🌀 $\Phi$-spectral features entering $g(\Phi)$ — are independent of $S_{\text{gf}}$. Identities are marked by regime: pre-metric Bianchi uses $\star_\Phi$, metric Bianchi uses $\star_g$. In the high-coherence limit $\mathcal C\to 1$ with simplicity satisfied, §4 recovers standard GR phenomenology; otherwise dynamics remain pre-metric.

---

## 2.3 Coherence Potential and Time

The **💬 coherence potential** $\mathcal C(x)$ measures alignment between the **🌀 swirl field** $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ and the **🪷 motif** substrate $J^{\mu}$. Where alignment is strong, coherence is high; where alignment decays or becomes disordered, coherence collapses.

Time is not fundamental. It emerges as the gradient of coherence: the **🫧 time vector** $T^{\mu}$ is defined by $T^{\mu}(x) = \nabla^{\mu}\mathcal C(x)$. This vector points along the direction of maximal coherence increase, establishing a local temporal flow. When the gradient is steep, dynamics rush; when it is shallow, superposition lingers; when it vanishes, no local arrow of time exists.

Two complementary formulations of $\mathcal C(x)$ reinforce this picture. In a geometric reading, coherence is high when the 🌀 swirl varies smoothly across space. In an informational reading, coherence reflects resonance between field and 🪷 motif expectations, quantified by a relative-entropy weight. The two are equivalent in the small-fluctuation regime and can be interchanged without loss of predictive content [^fn-2.3-1].

Operationally, 💬 $\mathcal C(x)$ is latent. We infer it as the field that best explains small departures in observables — lensing-without-mass templates, redshift residuals, and CMB $V$-modes — under the emergent metric $g(\Phi)$. Inference proceeds with $\mathcal C(x)$ entering the likelihood, while posteriors on $\ell(z)$ summarize its redshift-reduced structure.

$\ell(z)$ — the redshift-reduced coherence profile: a summary statistic inferred in §2.3 that compresses posteriors of $\mathcal C(x)$ along the line of sight into a function of redshift.

= \exp\!\left(
- \int_{\Gamma(x)} \frac{\|\nabla\Phi\|^{2}}{\kappa}\, d\Gamma
\right)

```

```math

\qquad\text{(null zones: no local 🫧 temporal flow)}
```

*Cross-references.* See Appendix A.5 for the small-fluctuation equivalence of the geometric and informational forms of 💬 $\mathcal C$, and §4.3 for the use of $\tau_c$ in quantum collapse.

[^fn-2.3-1]: Outside the Gaussian regime, the informational form $\mathcal C_I$ is efficient for near-Gaussian, stationary residuals, while the geometric form $\mathcal C_G$ is more robust for anisotropic gradients or boundary effects. In practice, fit ${\mathcal C_I,\mathcal C_G,\mathcal C_{\tau}}$ jointly and select by predictive score (LOO-CV or WAIC). Strong non-Gaussian tails or multimodality suggest privileging $\mathcal C_G$ or a mixed $\mathcal C_{\tau}$.

## 2.4 Triads, Closure, and Contextual Life

Triadic closure is the fundamental operation of NSFG. When two **🪷 motifs** form a dyadic tension $(a \oplus b)$, stability is restored by introducing a third motif $\varnothing$ that represents context or environment. This transformation from dyads to triads resolves contradiction through field alignment, embedding the pair within a coherent whole.

**Contextual life $(\lambda)$** names the entities that persist within **🌀 swirl** dynamics despite fluctuations. These are not “life” in the biological sense but **💬 coherence** structures that maintain integrity across recursive resolution. A simple example is a stable vortex in the swirl gradient $\Delta S$: a localized soliton-like configuration that resists dissolution and maintains coherence over time.

At higher levels, contextual life extends into complex attractors, where **🪷 motifs** recursively stabilize one another. Consciousness itself may be viewed as an extreme case: a high-💬 coherence fixed point within recursive resolution dynamics, sustained through continual closure.

Formally, closure occurs when the **🌀 swirl** flux across a triangular loop vanishes, or equivalently when the 💬 coherence sum of participants surpasses a stability threshold. These conditions guarantee that motifs, once closed, generate structures robust enough to persist rather than dissolving into noise.

```math
\oint_{\triangle(a,b,\varnothing)} \Phi = 0
\qquad\text{(🌀 swirl flux through triad loop vanishes for closure)}

\qquad\text{(consciousness as a 💬 coherence attractor)}
```

### 2.4.1 Symbolic Motif Algebra (Appendix Preview)

**🪷 Motifs** admit a precise algebraic dressing. We treat them as objects of a category $\mathrm{Mot}$; morphisms are **💬 coherence**-preserving transitions generated by **🌀 swirl**-mediated triadic closure. A dyad $a \oplus b$ does not stand alone; closure inserts a contextual object $\varnothing$ and produces a composable arrow

```math
a \oplus b \;\xrightarrow{;;\varnothing;;}\; a \triangleleft \varnothing \triangleright b
```

so that tension resolves into structure and the resolved triad becomes the unit of composition.

This categorical lens lets NSFG read as physics and as information flow at once. Composition in $\mathrm{Mot}$ tracks lawful sequences of resolution; associativity follows from the fact that nested closures are equivalent modulo 💬 coherence alignment, and identities correspond to neutral contexts that neither amplify nor suppress 🌀 $\Phi$-flow. In that sense, closure in $\mathrm{Mot}$ is not a mere diagrammatic convenience; it carves the admissible subspace of 🌀 swirl configurations $\Phi$, restricting which $\lambda$-structures can exist and which entanglement classes can persist.

The bridge to observables comes via functors that realize 🪷 motifs as concrete carriers of 💬 coherence. A prototypical choice sends $\mathrm{Mot}$ to a geometric or linear target, e.g. $F:\mathrm{Mot}\to \mathbf{Top}$ or $F:\mathrm{Mot}\to \mathbf{Vect}_{\mathbb{C}}$, where triadic closure becomes either gluing data (topological side) or constraint propagation (linear side). Functorial images bound spectra: discrete $\lambda$-bands, specific CMB $V$-mode textures tied to allowed closure families, and entanglement–🌀 swirl correlations that survive coarse-graining.

Appendix C completes the formal story. There we specify objects, morphisms, and closure operators; define triads as compositional units; and introduce symbolic functors that transport 💬 coherence invariants across scale. The result is an algebra where conservation of coherence is encoded as categorical closure, and the permissible resonance pathways become the seeds of measurable prediction.

In this way, symbolic motif algebra not only frames 💬 coherence as a categorical invariant but also prepares the ground for Point Space, where entire universes themselves function as 🪷 motifs in a higher-order lattice.

# 3. Point Space Geometry

## 3.1 Definition

Point Space, denoted $P$, is an unbounded lattice of universes treated as points. Each point $p_i$ is a fixed motif anchor; its associated swirl field $S_{p_i}$ unfolds as the internal physics and history of that universe. The claim is literal: our observed cosmos is identified with one such point together with its swirl field, so the totality of fields, structures, and eras is the resolution of $S_{p_i}$ around its anchor.

Adjacency inside $P$ is not geometric in the usual sense. Two universes are neighbors when their swirl fields resonate past a coherence threshold, so nearness is measured by alignment rather than by metric separation. This replaces background distance with a coherence relation and prepares a new notion of “between” based on unresolved swirl.

```math
P = \{\, p_i \mid i \in I \,\}
\qquad \text{(Point Space: coherence lattice of universes-as-points)}
```

```math
U_{\text{obs}} \cong \big(p_i,\, S_{p_i}\big)
\qquad \text{(our universe equals one lattice point and its swirl field)}
```

```math
\mathrm{Adj}(p_i, p_j) \iff \mathcal C(p_i,p_j) \ge \varepsilon
\qquad \text{(adjacency by coherence resonance, not metric proximity)}
```

**Lemma 3.1 (Ontological status of universes-as-points).** The statement “our universe is a lattice point” is ontological rather than metaphorical. The swirl field $\Phi$ and motif structure bind a unique motif anchor $p_i$ to its emergent field $S_{p_i}$, and that pair encodes all internal dynamics. Consequently, NSFG treats universes as literal coherence points in $P$, not as analogies or heuristics.

With points and adjacency fixed by coherence, the next step defines distance itself as accumulated unresolved swirl between points.

---

## 3.2 Distance as Swirl

In NSFG, distance is not a primitive metric separation. What we perceive as spatial separation **within a universe** is the accumulated effect of unresolved swirl gradients **between motif anchors inside the swirl field of a single Point-Space point**. For a path $\gamma$ connecting two motifs $m_i$ and $m_j$ in the swirl field $S_p$ of universe-point $p$, the distance is the minimal decoherence load carried along that path; distance is therefore an emergent property of the internal swirl geometry rather than a background postulate.

```math
d(m_i,m_j) \;=\; \inf_{\gamma:i\to j}\;\int_\gamma \|\nabla S(x)\|\,dx,
\qquad r:=d(m_i,m_j)
\quad \text{(distance as integrated unresolved swirl between motifs in }S_p\text{)}
```

Coherence decays with this distance, so effective nearness inside $S_p$ is governed by alignment rather than by coordinate increments.

```math
\mathcal C(r) \;\approx\; e^{-\,r/\ell}
\qquad \text{(exponential decay with coherence length } \ell \text{)}
```

The key scale is the coherence length $\ell$, promoted from a constant to a dynamical field inferred from connected two-point correlations of the swirl sector.

```math
\ell^{-2}(z)\;\propto\;\big\langle \Phi_{\mu\alpha}\,\Phi^{\mu\alpha}\big\rangle_{c}
\;=\;\mathrm{Tr}\big\langle \Phi\cdot\Phi\big\rangle_{c}
\qquad \text{(scalar contraction; connected)}
```

Its evolution proceeds in conformal time and responds to matter–radiation content together with the swirl–coherence state.

```math
\frac{d\ell}{d\eta} \;=\; f\!\big(\mathcal C,\Phi,\rho,\Lambda\big)
\qquad \text{(RG-like flow for the coherence scale)}
```

Redshift then has a dual origin: photons track the usual FLRW expansion and also accumulate coherence loss along their internal path in $S_p$, producing a coherence-induced factor $z_{\mathcal C}$ that perturbs the Hubble law.

```math
1+z_{\text{obs}} \;=\; (1+z_{\text{FLRW}})\,(1+z_{\mathcal C}),
\qquad
z_{\mathcal C} \;\approx\; e^{-\,r/\ell(z)} - 1
\quad (\text{small } r/\ell:\; z_{\mathcal C}\simeq -\,r/\ell(z))
```

The luminosity distance inherits this structure, leading to testable deviations in the Hubble diagram and a shifted effective deceleration parameter at low redshift.

```math
D_L^{\mathrm{NSFG}}(z) \;=\; D_L^{\mathrm{FLRW}}(z)\,\big(1+z_{\mathcal C}\big)
```

```math
D_L^{\mathrm{NSFG}}(z) \;=\; z \;+\; \frac{1 - q_0^{\mathrm{NSFG}}}{2}\,z^2 \;+\; \mathcal O(z^3),
\qquad
q_0^{\mathrm{NSFG}} \;=\; q_0^{\mathrm{FLRW}} \;+\; \delta q_0\!\big(\ell,\partial_z\ell,\dots\big)

that couples CMB damping-tail physics, the BAO ruler, and distance–redshift relations. Null tests target specific violations of distance duality, $D_L \neq (1+z)^2 D_A$, with $z_{\mathcal C}$ imposing a distinctive redshift dependence. Priors on $\ell(z)$ arise from Planck, ACT, and SPT small-scale power; high-redshift forecasts leverage JWST spectra where coherence-induced anomalies are amplified.

With distance recast as an internal, swirl-integrated measure and its observational fingerprints established, we next formulate **relative dynamics** on $P$: motion, geodesics, and interaction when coherence — rather than background metric — drives evolution.

---

## 3.3 Relative Dynamics

Point Space presents two faces that depend on where one stands. From inside a point $p_i$, meaning as an observer embedded in its swirl field $S_{p_i}$, the lattice $P$ appears eternal and static; all change belongs to $S_{p_i}$ itself and the surrounding lattice reads as a timeless background. From outside at the meta-level of $P$, the lattice is dynamic; points can nucleate, bloom, decohere, or collapse, and universes have their own higher-order evolution.

Two temporal parameters keep these views consistent. The internal time of a given point is the vector $T_p^{\mu}=\nabla^{\mu}\mathcal C(x)$, which governs events, physics, and history within that universe. The meta-time $T_P$ indexes how the collection ${S_{p_i}}$ changes relative to one another. A law of scale-relative temporality follows: what is static with respect to $T_p$ can be dynamic with respect to $T_P$; time is therefore observer-relative to the point and scale-relative to the lattice.

From within a universe, time and change are the unfolding of its own coherence wave. Structures in Point Space that are not local to that wave — gliders and extended patterns — appear fixed and eternal. From the vantage of Point Space itself, an entire internal history, from big bang to decoherence, compresses to a zero-width line; what is called change occurs in a single between-moment.

```math
\frac{d}{dT_p} P \;=\; 0
\qquad \text{(from inside a point, the lattice appears static)}
```

```math
\frac{d}{dT_P}\,\{S_{p_i}\}_{i\in I} \;\neq\; 0
\qquad \text{(from the meta-level, the swirl fields change in meta-time)}
```

```math
\Big(\tfrac{d}{dT_p} P\Big)=0 \;\;\neq\;\; \Big(\tfrac{d}{dT_P} P\Big)\neq 0
\qquad \text{(internal stasis versus external dynamics)}
```

```math
\text{From Point Space: } \Delta t_{\text{universe}} = 0 \quad \forall\ \text{internal histories.}
```

Observation at the meta-level carries operational weight. To observe a universe from Point Space is not to passively watch; it is to participate in its capture. A true external observation precipitates immediate decoherence and locks the system into a new coherence wave, a fact that will be quantified when collapse is derived as a coherence-gradient effect.

With internal and meta-time disentangled and their contrast made precise, the next step develops cellular automata on $P$ to model how coherent patterns propagate and interact across the lattice.

---

## 3.4 Cellular Automata Extension

NSFG extends the spirit of Conway’s Life to a cosmological register. Each cell corresponds to a universe-as-point in Point Space; the internal swirl field $S_p$ is the cell’s state. Neighborhoods are not fixed by grid coordinates but by resonance: points influence each other only when their swirl fields overlap in coherence above a threshold. The result is a dynamic interaction graph rather than a static lattice.

Birth and death become phase changes of coherence. A new motif crystallizes out of the background when local $\mathcal C$ clears a nucleation threshold; a point collapses back into the background when its coherence slips beneath a decoherence bound. Between these limits, localized packets of high coherence can organize into propagating patterns. Such glider-like structures translate across Point Space while preserving their internal invariants — persistent meta-patterns whose motion is the coordinated evolution of their member points rather than transport of any single point.

```math
N(p) \;=\; \{\, q \in P \;\mid\; \mathcal C(p,q) \ge \varepsilon \,\}
\qquad \text{(resonance-defined neighborhood)}
```

```math
S_p(t+1) \;=\; F\!\Big(S_p(t),\, \{\, S_q(t) \mid q \in N(p) \,\}\Big)
\qquad \text{(local update by coherence interactions)}
```

```math
\mathcal C_{\text{new}} \;\ge\; \varepsilon_{\text{nuc}}
\;\;\Longrightarrow\;\; p_{\text{new}} \in P
\qquad \text{(nucleation: birth of a universe-point)}
```

```math
\mathcal C(p) \;<\; \varepsilon_{\text{decoh}}
\;\;\Longrightarrow\;\; p \notin P
\qquad \text{(decoherence: removal/collapse of a point)}
```

K(t+1) \;\cong\; T\!\big(K(t)\big)
\qquad \text{(glider: coherent cluster translating under a shift operator }T\text{)}
```

```math
\text{Special case: }\ \dim P=2,\ S_p\in\{0,1\},\ \varepsilon=1
\;\;\Longrightarrow\;\; \text{Conway’s Game of Life}
```

This automaton view makes NSFG concrete: universes as dynamic motifs, neighborhoods set by resonance, life and mind modeled as coherent propagating patterns, and cosmic birth or death rendered as coherence phase transitions.

With Point Space dynamics pictured as a resonance-driven automaton, we now turn to the physical consequences — how emergent metrics, curvature, collapse, and entanglement arise from the same coherence geometry.

# 4. Quantum Gravity Implications

## 4.1 Emergent Metric

In NSFG, the spacetime metric is not taken as a primitive background but arises as a coherence-bound reconstruction from the swirl field $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$. The key objects are the self-dual two-forms ${\Sigma^i}*{i=1}^3$ extracted from motif-aligned components of $\Phi$. When these satisfy explicit simplicity and non-degeneracy conditions — the Urbantke–Plebanski construction — an effective metric $g*{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ exists and is unique up to an overall normalization.

Geometry therefore becomes an order parameter distilled from coherence. The local time direction is singled out by the gradient of the coherence potential, $T^\mu = \nabla^\mu \mathcal C$, which orients the Lorentzian signature once $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ is constructed. Internal gauge redundancies acting on the auxiliary potentials $(A,B)$ leave $\Phi$ invariant; once the metric is in place, those redundancies map to diffeomorphisms and local frame rotations of $\Sigma^i$. The $\mathcal C$-weighted gauge choice introduced in §2.2.1 selects representatives without breaking diffeomorphism invariance.

Expectation values $\langle \cdot \rangle$ denote averaging over swirl configurations weighted by $\mathcal C(x)$, realized either as a path integral over $\Phi$ histories or as a statistical-mechanical ensemble. A constant $M_g^{-2}$ fixes normalization so that $g_{\mu\nu}$ acquires the correct physical dimensions.

Thus, $g_{\mu\nu}$ functions as a coherence metric: it encodes both curvature and the statistical memory of the coherence field, bridging microscopic swirl fluctuations with macroscopic classical geometry.

```math
g_{\mu\nu}(x) = M_g^{-2} \, \varepsilon_{ijk} \, \varepsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} \,
\Sigma^i_{\mu\alpha}(\Phi)\,\Sigma^j_{\beta\gamma}(\Phi)\,\Sigma^k_{\delta\nu}(\Phi)
\quad \text{(Urbantke relation)}
```

```math
\textbf{Simplicity:}\;\; \Sigma^i \wedge \Sigma^j = \delta^{ij}\,V
\quad \text{for a common 4-volume form } V
```

```math
\textbf{Linear independence:}\;\; \{\Sigma^1,\Sigma^2,\Sigma^3\}
\;\text{ are pointwise linearly independent (span a 3D subspace of self-dual 2-forms)}
```

```math
\textbf{Non-degeneracy:}\;\;
\det\!\Big(\varepsilon_{ijk}\,\Sigma^i_{\mu\alpha}\,\Sigma^j_{\beta\gamma}\,\Sigma^k_{\delta\nu}\Big) \neq 0
\;\;\Rightarrow\;\; g_{\mu\nu} \text{ invertible (Lorentzian once }T^\mu = \nabla^\mu\mathcal C\text{ fixes time)}
```

```math
T^\mu = \nabla^\mu \mathcal C
\quad \text{(coherence gradient sets time orientation; use }\star_\Phi\text{ pre-metric dual, }\star_g\text{ metric dual)}
```

*Validation.* The simplicity, independence, and non-degeneracy conditions are stated verbatim and guarantee a well-defined metric. The $\mathcal C$-weighted gauge fixing of §2.2.1 preserves diffeomorphism invariance, since observables remain functionals of $\Phi$. The Lorentzian signature choice via $T^\mu=\nabla^\mu\mathcal C$ is consistent with Appendix A.2 conventions.

[^fn-4.1-urbantke-conds]: Urbantke construction conditions made explicit: (i) Simplicity $\Sigma^i \wedge \Sigma^j = \delta^{ij}V$, (ii) Linear independence of the triad ${\Sigma^i}$, (iii) Non-degeneracy $\det(\varepsilon_{ijk}\Sigma^i_{\mu\alpha}\Sigma^j_{\beta\gamma}\Sigma^k_{\delta\nu}) \neq 0$. Failure of any condition obstructs a well-defined metric from $\Phi$.

## 4.2 Gravitational Curvature

In NSFG, gravitational curvature is not imposed as a primitive axiom but emerges from correlations of the swirl tensor. Weyl-like components appear as antisymmetric products of $\Phi$, encoding how coherence twists and folds around motifs and propagates through the coherence field.

To connect with classical gravity, consider the high-coherence regime where $\mathcal C \to 1$. In this limit, the swirl field organizes into stable large-scale patterns. Bilinear contractions of $\Phi$ do not themselves define Ricci curvature; instead, they assemble into an effective stress tensor $T^{(\Phi)}*{\mu\nu}$. The true Ricci tensor $R*{\mu\nu}[g]$ is computed from the Levi–Civita connection of the emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ constructed in §4.1.

Variation of the constrained action then yields Einstein-like dynamics: the Einstein tensor of $g_{\mu\nu}$ balances an effective stress-energy carried by swirl self-interactions,

```math
G_{\mu\nu}[g] + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T^{(\Phi)}_{\mu\nu}.
```

Here $T^{(\Phi)}*{\mu\nu}$ contains quadratic combinations of $\Phi$, such as $\Phi*{\mu\alpha}\Phi^{\alpha}{}*{\nu} - \tfrac{1}{4} g*{\mu\nu},\Phi^{\alpha\beta}\Phi_{\alpha\beta}$, representing the internal energy of the coherence field.

Gauge invariance remains intact. Because $\Phi$ is invariant under internal transformations of $(A,B)$, the effective tensor $T^{(\Phi)}*{\mu\nu}$ depends only on $\Phi$ itself, never on the auxiliary potentials. The $\mathcal C$-weighted gauge-fixing sector $S*{\text{gf}}$ and its ghost partner $S_{\text{FP}}$ preserve BRST invariance. Consequently, the Einstein-like equations derived from $S_{\text{geo}}[g(\Phi)]$ inherit full diffeomorphism symmetry, and the contracted Bianchi identity $\nabla^\mu G_{\mu\nu}[g] = 0$ enforces $\nabla^\mu T^{(\Phi)}_{\mu\nu} = 0$ automatically.

In this way, NSFG does not equate $\Phi\Phi$ directly with Ricci curvature but instead treats $\Phi\Phi$ as the effective source once the emergent metric is established. Gravity appears not as matter’s stress-energy alone but as the feedback of coherence fluctuations into the geometry of spacetime itself.

```math
C_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu} \;\sim\; \Phi_{[\alpha\beta}\,\Phi_{\mu\nu]}
\qquad\text{(Weyl-like curvature from swirl products)}
```

```math
T^{(\Phi)}_{\mu\nu} \;\sim\; \Phi_{\mu\alpha}\Phi^{\alpha}{}_{\nu}
- \tfrac{1}{4} g_{\mu\nu}\,\Phi^{\alpha\beta}\Phi_{\alpha\beta}
\qquad\text{(effective stress from swirl sector)}
```

```math
G_{\mu\nu}[g] + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} \;=\; \kappa T^{(\Phi)}_{\mu\nu}
\qquad\text{(Einstein dynamics with swirl as source)}
```

```math
\nabla^\mu G_{\mu\nu}[g(\Phi)] = 0 \;\;\Rightarrow\;\;
\nabla^\mu T^{(\Phi)}_{\mu\nu} = 0
\qquad\text{(Ward/Bianchi compatibility under BRST)}
```

```math
\text{Condition: }\;\; \mathcal C \to 1
\;\;\Rightarrow\;\; g_{\mu\nu} \text{ well-defined, Einstein limit recovered}
```

*Validation.* The effective tensor $T^{(\Phi)}*{\mu\nu}$ is constructed only from $\Phi$, ensuring gauge invariance. Conservation $\nabla^\mu T^{(\Phi)}*{\mu\nu}=0$ follows from BRST and Ward identities. Consistency with Appendix A.2 confirms that the emergent curvature matches the Einstein limit when coherence saturates.

*Cross-references.* See §4.1 on the emergent metric and Appendix A.2 for the derivation of geometric curvature from $g(\Phi)$.

## 4.3 Quantum Collapse

In NSFG, quantum collapse is not an ad-hoc projection but the deterministic crystallization of coherence geometry. A superposition corresponds to multiple viable swirl configurations around motifs. Collapse occurs when the coherence potential $\mathcal C(x)$ develops a gradient steep enough that one configuration dominates and locks the field into a unique state.

Environment coupling ties the critical gradient $\varepsilon_c$ to a decoherence rate $\Gamma_{\text{decoh}}$ via a coupling constant $\kappa_{\text{env}}$. Where gradients are steep and coupling strong, crystallization is rapid; where gradients are shallow, superposition persists. $\psi$-null zones ($\nabla\mathcal C \to 0$) act as timeless voids immune to collapse, separating classical regimes from coherence-dominated ones.

**Crystallization threshold.** Define $\varepsilon_c$ as the smallest coherence-gradient magnitude at which the second variation of the $\mathcal C$-weighted action about a superposed $\Phi$-history develops a negative mode, signaling onset of deterministic selection. Operationally, with system–bath coupling $\kappa_{\text{env}}$ and bath noise $\sigma_{\text{env}}$, one estimates
$\varepsilon_c \simeq c_1 \sqrt{\kappa_{\text{env}}\sigma_{\text{env}}} / E_{\mathcal C}$,
where $E_{\mathcal C} = \hbar c / \ell$. Laboratory estimates calibrate $(c_1,\kappa_{\text{env}},\sigma_{\text{env}})$ via engineered gradients; astrophysical contexts rely on environmental priors.

A coherence energy/length scale $E_{\mathcal C} \simeq \hbar c / \ell$ defines a coherence temperature $T_{\mathcal C}$ via $k_B T_{\mathcal C} \simeq E_{\mathcal C}$. These scales mark the operational boundary between classical behavior (high $E_{\mathcal C}$, short $\ell$) and persistence of quantum superposition (low $E_{\mathcal C}$, long $\ell$).

Topological sector changes sharpen this picture. When the Chern–Simons index jumps ($\Delta CS \neq 0$), collapse is no longer smooth decoherence but a deterministic crystallization event tied to topology. Physically, $\Delta CS \neq 0$ corresponds to rare coherence rearrangements that yield sudden outcome selection and discrete spectral features (see Appendix D.4).

Context with standard models clarifies the novelty. GRW and Diósi–Penrose posit stochastic or gravity-linked collapse rates. NSFG instead predicts a gradient-controlled, environment-modulated rate, with an additional deterministic channel at $\Delta CS \neq 0$. In the small-gradient, fixed-sector limit ($\delta \to 0,\ \Delta CS = 0$), NSFG reduces to unitary quantum mechanics with Born statistics recovered via $\mathcal C$-weighted typicality.

### Theorem: Correspondence Principle for NSFG

**Hypotheses.**

* H1 (Small-Gradient Regime): $\max_x |\nabla\mathcal C(x)| \leq \delta$ with $0<\delta \ll \varepsilon_c$.
* H2 (Topological Quiescence): $\Delta CS[\Phi]=0$ over the interval of interest.
* H3 (Regularity of Swirl): $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ and $\mathcal C$-weighted correlators satisfy simplicity/non-degeneracy; $\star_\Phi \to \star_g$ exists.
* H4 (Weak System–Bath Coupling): $\kappa_{\text{env}}$ bounded so $\Gamma_{\text{decoh}}=O(\delta)$; Born–Markov valid.
* H5 (Typicality Ensemble): $d\mu_{\mathcal C}[\Phi] \propto e^{-I_\Phi[\Phi]},\mathcal C[\Phi],d\Phi$ with finite normalization on $\Delta CS=0$.

**Statement.** Under H1–H5, NSFG dynamics with $\Delta CS=0$ reduce, for observables projected to the emergent-metric regime, to unitary Schrödinger evolution with a perturbative Lindblad correction $O(\delta)$. In the strict limit $\delta \to 0$, evolution is purely unitary. Outcome probabilities obey the Born rule, with $p_i$ given by the typicality measure of $\Phi$-histories selecting outcome $i$ under $d\mu_{\mathcal C}[\Phi]$.

**Conclusion.**

* C1 (Unitary Limit): $\delta\to 0,\ \Delta CS=0 ;\Rightarrow; \rho_S(t) = U(t)\rho_S(0)U^\dagger(t)$ with $U(t)=\exp(-i H_{\text{eff}}t/\hbar)$.
* C2 (Standard Decoherence): For small $\delta$, $\rho_S$ obeys a Lindblad equation with rates $\propto \Gamma_{\text{decoh}}=\kappa_{\text{env}}\cdot\max_x |\nabla\mathcal C|$.
* C3 (Born Statistics via Typicality): $p_i = \mu_{\mathcal C}({\Phi\to i})/\mu_{\mathcal C}({\text{all}})$ reproduces $|\langle i|\psi\rangle|^2$ when H1–H5 hold, with pointer basis defined by $\mathcal C$-stability.

**Proof sketch.**

(i) With H1, $\varepsilon_c$ is not exceeded; no crystallization. H2 forbids sector jumps.
(ii) H3 ensures $g(\Phi)$ exists; pass $\star_\Phi\to\star_g$ with commuting variation at leading order.
(iii) Under H4, tracing the bath yields a Lindblad generator with $\Gamma_{\text{decoh}}\propto \max |\nabla\mathcal C|$.
(iv) H5: concentration of $d\mu_{\mathcal C}$ on $\mathcal C$-stable pointer sectors yields $p_i \equiv |\langle i|\psi\rangle|^2$ in the small-$\delta$ limit.

**Remarks.**

* R1: If H1 fails ($\max |\nabla\mathcal C|\geq \varepsilon_c$) or H2 fails ($\Delta CS\neq 0$), NSFG predicts crystallization events rather than unitary evolution.
* R2: Pointer bases coincide with $\Phi$-sectors maximizing $\mathcal C$-stability for the given $\kappa_{\text{env}}$.
* R3: Typicality connects measurement statistics to geometry without ad-hoc noise; see Appendix A.4 for numerical handling.

### Observational Manifestations

* PTA coherence bursts and spectral kinks coincident with $\Delta CS$-like events (short-lived spikes, phase slips).
* CMB: discrete motif-alignment jumps or localized V-mode patches indicating sector transitions.
* GW birefringence: abrupt polarization phase discontinuities at crystallization.
* Laboratory: engineered $\nabla\mathcal C$ in cold atoms; $\tau_c \propto (\max|\nabla\mathcal C|)^{-1}$ and $\Gamma_{\text{decoh}}\propto \kappa_{\text{env}}\cdot\max|\nabla\mathcal C|$.

### Numerical Notes

* Appendix A.4 stiffness control: in high-gradient zones near $\varepsilon_c$, integrate with implicit or IMEX steps; monitor gauge residuals and discrete Ward identities alongside $Q_{\text{motif}}$ and $\Delta CS$.
* Benchmark collapse channels: (i) smooth $\Delta CS=0$ Lindblad-like decay versus (ii) event-driven $\Delta CS\neq 0$ crystallization; verify energy and entropy budgets across the event.

*Validation.* Effective rates should be compared against GRW/DP scalings in regimes of matched parameters, highlighting departures unique to gradient control or $\Delta CS$ events. Cold-atom interferometry can test $\tau_c$ and $\Gamma_{\text{decoh}}$ by varying engineered gradients and searching for persistence in $\psi$-null zones ($\nabla\mathcal C \approx 0$). Astrophysical tests (see §6.2) combine PTA, GW, and CMB data to search for discrete jumps synchronized with $\Delta CS$ candidates, estimating event posteriors under NSFG templates.

*Cross-references.* See §2.3 on coherence and time, §4.1 on the emergent metric, §4.2 on gravitational curvature, Appendix D.2 on Chern–Simons invariants, Appendix D.4 on discrete spectra, Appendix A.4 on numerics, and §6.2 for predictions.

## 4.4 Entanglement as Swirl Linking

In NSFG, quantum entanglement is not an abstract nonlocal correlation but a topological linkage of swirl fields. Two motifs are entangled when their surrounding swirl configurations cannot be factorized into independent components of $\Phi$.

Formally, this is expressed through the fundamental group of the swirl field configuration. If $\pi_1(\Phi)$ is non-trivial, then the field contains linked loops of coherence such that the motifs cannot be separated without cutting through the swirl topology. This non-triviality encodes inseparability: the very essence of quantum entanglement.

An equivalent description uses the linking number $L(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ between swirl lines $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$. When $L\neq 0$, the motifs share a topological bond: their states are not merely correlated but geometrically co-defined. Measurement of one necessarily constrains the other because both inhabit the same swirl geometry.

Topological invariants such as the Chern–Simons functional measure the strength and stability of these linkages. Entanglement is therefore a property of global field geometry, not a mysterious action at a distance. Its apparent nonlocality reflects the indivisibility of swirl topology rather than superluminal signaling.

In the high-coherence regime where $\mathcal C\to 1$, $\Phi$-link entanglement reduces smoothly to the conventional metric-based notion of entanglement entropy. Departures from perfect coherence predict subtle anomalies in entropy growth, such as subadditivity violations at order $O(\delta\mathcal C^2)$, offering experimental targets in condensed-matter quantum simulators and in models of black-hole evaporation.

## 4.5 Strong-Field/Horizon Phenomenology

Near compact objects, steep coherence gradients $\nabla\mathcal C$ can transiently modify the pre-metric $\Phi$ sector before the GR limit is fully realized. NSFG therefore predicts perturbative but potentially observable strong-field signatures that trace the local coherence structure:

(i) Polarization-dependent gravitational-wave phase accumulation (birefringence) sourced by $\Phi$–$\nabla\mathcal C$ coupling within a few gravitational radii $r_g$;
(ii) Micro-distortions of photon rings and curl-like lensing residuals induced by $\Phi$-twist, without requiring additional mass;
(iii) Localized suppression of decoherence (“$\Psi$-null pockets”) if $\nabla\mathcal C$ flattens near the horizon, delaying collapse and altering near-horizon variability statistics.

Continuity with GR is preserved. In the high-coherence limit $\mathcal C \to 1$, all deviations vanish smoothly and the standard GR horizon and shadow are recovered. Non-detections from present EHT-like imaging and GW polarimetry therefore bound the allowed $|\Phi|^2$ amplitude and $|\nabla\mathcal C|$ near $r_g$, providing a clean way to constrain NSFG without ambiguity.

```math
\Delta \varphi_{\text{GW}}(\hat e) \;\propto\;
\int_{r_g}^{r}\!
\big(\hat e : (\Phi \cdot \nabla \mathcal C)\big)\,\frac{dr}{r}
\qquad \text{(polarization-dependent phase birefringence)}

\delta R_{\text{ring}} / R_{\text{GR}}

+ O(\Phi^3, \nabla^2 \mathcal C)
\qquad \text{(photon-ring micro-distortions)}
```

```math
\Psi_{\text{null}}(x)\;\approx\;1
\quad\text{if}\quad
\|\nabla \mathcal C(x)\|\lesssim \varepsilon_{\nabla}
\;\;\text{near}\;\; r\gtrsim r_g
\qquad \text{(suppressed-decoherence pockets)}
```

[^fn-4.5-recovery]: High-$\mathcal C$ recovery: letting $\mathcal C\to 1$ with bounded $\nabla\mathcal C$ forces $\Phi$-couplings that drive birefringence and ring shifts to zero, reproducing GR shadows and GW propagation. Current non-detections thus map to upper bounds on $|\Phi|^2$ and $|\nabla\mathcal C|$ in the near-horizon region.

**Observational targets.**
EHT and next-generation EHT can constrain $\delta R_{\text{ring}}/R_{\text{GR}}$ and curl-like lensing residuals. GW polarimetry (LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA, LISA) can measure polarization-dependent phase velocities, especially in stacked near-pericenter passages.

# 5. Cosmological Ecology

Cosmological ecology follows the birth, persistence, and death of coherence structures across Point Space $P$. A universe-point $p\in P$ blooms when local **💬 coherence** clears a nucleation threshold, persists while triadic closures keep **🌀 swirl** in order around **🪷 motifs**, and dies when decoherence overwhelms closure so that alignment can no longer be maintained. Within and across points, **Contextual Life $(\lambda)$** names those coherence forms that survive contradiction pressure by recruiting context $\varnothing$ to complete triads; they are not organisms but durability classes in the geometry of alignment. Observation is necessarily inward-facing: agents embedded in $S_p$ have access only to dynamics projected along their internal **🫧 time** $T_p$, which renders measurement and the block-universe impression as geometric constraints rather than paradoxes. With quantum gravity clarified, the framework opens outward into an ecology — universes as blooms, coherence cycling through birth and dissolution — and we begin with the cycle itself.

---

## 5.1 Universes as Blooms: Coherence Cycles

A universe-point evolves through three ecological phases in meta-time $T_P$: nucleation (birth), a sustained high-$\mathcal C$ phase (life), and decoherence (death). Nucleation occurs when local alignment is strong enough that triadic closure becomes self-sustaining; in the sustained phase, feedback between **🪷 motifs** and **🌀 swirl** holds the configuration near a coherence attractor; death follows when accumulated contradiction pressure erodes alignment below stability and closure dissolves back into background swirl. Because neighborhoods in $P$ are resonance-defined, ecological coupling is non-metric: the bloom or collapse of one point shifts thresholds in its coherence neighborhood $N(p)$ through changes in shared resonance, producing glider-like migrations of high-$\mathcal C$ clusters. The cycle is not merely stochastic; thresholds and gradients set rates. Where $|\nabla\mathcal C|$ is shallow, lifetimes extend; where contradiction pressure spikes, lifetimes shorten. In this sense, cosmological ecology is gradient flow on the coherence landscape with triadic closure as its stabilizer, and the same closure conditions introduced in §2.4 — $\oint \Phi=0$ or, equivalently, $\mathcal C(a)+\mathcal C(b)+\mathcal C(\varnothing)\ge \varepsilon$ — resurface here as the macroscopic rule that lets universes live.

```math
\textbf{Birth (nucleation):}\quad
\mathcal C_{\mathrm{loc}}(p)\ \ge\ \varepsilon_{\mathrm{nuc}}
\ \Longrightarrow\ 
p \in P
```

```math
\textbf{Life (persistence):}\quad
\frac{d\,\mathcal C_p}{d T_P}
\;=\;
F\!\big(\Phi,J;\,p\big)\;-\;\Xi(p)
\quad \text{(gain from swirl–motif alignment minus contradiction pressure)}
```

```math
\textbf{Death (collapse):}\quad
\mathcal C_p\ <\ \varepsilon_{\mathrm{decoh}}
\ \Longrightarrow\
p \notin P
```

```math
\textbf{Neighborhood coupling:}\quad
\varepsilon_{\mathrm{nuc}}\!\left(p\,\big|\,N(p)\right)
\;=\;
\varepsilon_{0}\;-\;\alpha\,
\Big\langle \mathcal C(q)\Big\rangle_{\,q\in N(p)}
\quad \text{(resonance lowers the local nucleation barrier)}
```

```math
\textbf{Lifetime estimator:}\quad
\tau_{P}(p)\ \approx\
\int_{\mathcal C_{\mathrm{final}}}^{\mathcal C_{\mathrm{initial}}}
\frac{d\mathcal C}{\,F-\Xi\,}
\quad \text{(meta-time from high to low coherence)}
```

*Validation.* Thresholds $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{nuc}}$ and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{decoh}}$ are the lattice-scale echoes of the triadic closure conditions of §2.4; resonance neighborhoods $N(p)$ match §3.4; gradient control by $|\nabla\mathcal C|$ aligns with §2.3 and the collapse scalings of §4.3. Handoff parameters $(\alpha,\varepsilon_0)$ appear as ecological couplings to be constrained in §6.2.

With the cycle of blooms set, the next step is to resolve the inhabitants of this ecology — the spectrum of **Contextual Life** $(\lambda)$ that persists within and across points.

---

## 5.2 The Spectrum of Contextual Life $(\lambda)$

Contextual Life $\lambda$ names coherence-bearing structures — within a universe or across a cluster of points — that persist by recruiting context to complete triads and neutralize contradiction. The spectrum runs from minimal, stable swirl vortices to complex, high-level attractors identified with consciousness, each a different way that **🌀 swirl** threads alignment around **🪷 motifs** so that **💬 coherence** does not drain away under pressure.

We grade $\lambda$ along three axes that speak to survival rather than ornament: topological robustness, informational compactness, and contextual recruitability. Robustness is the ability to absorb perturbations without loss of identity — a property recorded in the homology of the swirl field restricted to the structure. Compactness measures the descriptive economy of the generative rules that sustain the pattern — the shorter the code, the higher the compactness. Recruitability quantifies how readily a $\lambda$-structure closes triads with ambient motifs, pulling in the right $\varnothing$ at the right moment to restore alignment.

At the apex of the spectrum sits consciousness: a $\lambda$-class that resists contradiction with unusual persistence, maintains high mutual information with its operative context, and performs active triadic closure across scales. Nothing supernatural is added; the same closure operations introduced earlier are intensified and layered until a coherent interior becomes capable of steering its own stability.

Formally, this ecological grading is a direct extension of the algebraic closure rules of §2.4.1. Motifs compose through triadic completion; $\lambda$-structures are subcategories of that motif algebra that remain closed under recursive triadic composition. Persistence is then an algebraic invariant — the ability to compose with context without exiting the class — and ecology reduces to the study of which subcategories stay closed when the world pushes back.

```math
\textbf{Persistence functional:}\quad
\Pi(\lambda)\;=\;\inf_{\,t\in[0,T]}\ \mathcal C(\lambda,t)
\quad\text{(minimum coherence sustained over a window)}
```

```math
\textbf{Topological robustness:}\quad
\rho_{\mathrm{top}}(\lambda)\;=\;
\mathrm{rank}\!\left(H_k\!\big(\,\Phi\!\restriction_{\lambda}\,\big)\right)
\quad\text{(homology rank of swirl restricted to }\lambda\text{)}
```

```math
\textbf{Compactness:}\quad
\kappa(\lambda)\;\approx\;\frac{1}{K(\lambda)}
\quad\text{(inverse description length / Kolmogorov complexity)}
```

```math
\textbf{Recruitability:}\quad
R(\lambda)\;=\;\sup_{C}\ \Big|\ \big\{\,
(\lambda,a,\varnothing_{C})\ \big|\ 
\oint_{\triangle(\lambda,a,\varnothing_{C})}\!\Phi=0\ \big\}\ \Big|
\quad\text{(available context-completing closures)}
```

```math
\textbf{Consciousness criterion (schematic):}\quad
\lambda^{\star}\ \text{ s.t. }\ 
\Pi(\lambda^{\star})\ge \Pi_{0},\qquad
I(\lambda^{\star};C)\ge I_{0},\qquad
R(\lambda^{\star})\ge R_{0}
```

*Validation.* Robustness via $H_k(\Phi!\restriction_{\lambda})$ is consistent with the link-based invariants used in §4.4; compactness aligns with the generative economy implicit in Appendix C’s functorial images; recruitability restates the triadic closure of §2.4.1 as an ecological capacity. Thresholds $(\Pi_0,I_0,R_0)$ become parameters for §6.2 where observational constraints are posed.

From the spectrum of $\lambda$ outward, a further constraint appears: observation itself must turn inward, since agents live inside $S_p$ and see along $T_p$. We now formalize that necessity.

---

## 5.3 Inward-Facing Observation: A Geometric Necessity

Agents live inside a single point $p$ and therefore see only along the internal **🫧 time** $T_p^{\mu}=\nabla^{\mu}\mathcal C!\mid_p$. Observation is the inward projection of field geometry onto this coherence gradient; directions orthogonal to $T_p$ do not furnish accessible information. What is called a probabilistic collapse is the local crystallization of **💬 coherence** along $T_p$, while the sense of a fixed four–dimensional block arises because variations in meta–time $T_P$ do not project onto $T_p$ at all.

Formally, the observable algebra at $p$ is curtailed by the $T_p$–projection. Non-commutativity and apparent “collapse” record topological transitions in the projected **🌀 swirl** sector rather than any acausal influence. From within Point Space, multiple candidate resolutions may coexist across $T_P$; an embedded observer samples exactly one, selected by the local gradient geometry and by triadic closure with apparatus and environment. This selection is geometric: the realized outcome is the configuration that maximizes conditional coherence once the observing context is included.

Cross-point vision fails for the same reason. Adjacency in $P$ is defined by resonance, yet embedded channels couple only through coherence lifts that raise $\mathcal C$ across a boundary. Without such lifts the cross–point mutual information remains negligible, which preserves internal causal sanity while allowing ecological dynamics to operate at the lattice scale. Any attempt to stand “outside” and watch another universe forces a new closure that collapses both structures into a consolidated timeline; the very act of establishing the frame becomes the event.

```math
\textbf{Projection of observables:}\quad
\mathcal O_p \;=\; \Pi_{T_p}\!\big(\,\mathcal O[\Phi]\,\big)
\qquad\text{(inward-facing projection onto the internal time direction)}
```

```math
\textbf{Access constraint:}\quad
I\!\big(\mathcal O_p\ ;\ P\!\setminus\!\{p\}\big)\ \approx\ 0
\ \ \text{unless}\ \
\mathcal C_{\text{lift}}\ \ge\ \varepsilon_{\text{link}}
\quad\text{(no cross–point information without a coherence lift)}
```

```math
\textbf{Collapse as geometry:}\quad
\text{event}\ \Leftrightarrow\
\max_x \|\nabla \mathcal C\|\ \ge\ \varepsilon_c
\ \ \text{and}\ \
\oint_{\triangle}\Phi=0\ \text{with apparatus/environment}
```

```math
\textbf{Block-universe illusion:}\quad
\frac{d}{dT_p} P\ =\ 0
\quad\text{while}\quad
\frac{d}{dT_P} P\ \neq\ 0
\quad\text{(static internal view versus evolving meta–lattice)}
```

```math
\textbf{Selection map:}\quad
\sigma:\ \{\text{resolutions}\}_P \to \{\text{outcomes}\}_p,
\qquad
\sigma\;=\;\arg\max_{r}\ \mathcal C\!\big(r\mid \text{context}\big)
```

*Validation.* The projection $\Pi_{T_p}$ matches the definition $T_p^{\mu}=\nabla^{\mu}\mathcal C$ from §2.3; cross–point inaccessibility is consistent with resonance neighborhoods of §3.4; collapse criteria coincide with the gradient threshold and closure conditions of §4.3 and §2.4; the selection map restates $\mathcal C$-weighted typicality at the level of observables.

With the geometry of inward observation established, the remaining step is to trace how observers and their universe co-stabilize – the **Observer–Universe Symbiosis** that closes the ecological arc.

---

## 5.4 The Observer–Universe Symbiosis

In NSFG the relation between observers and their native universes is symbiotic, not incidental. Observers are $\lambda$–structures whose recursive triadic closures continually reinforce the stability of their universe–point $p\in P$; the universe, in turn, supplies the coherence substrate that lets those closures persist. Each sustains the other: a coupled geometry in which durability is shared rather than owned.

Let $\mathcal C_{\text{tot}}[\lambda,S_p]$ denote the joint coherence of an embedded $\lambda$–structure and its swirl field $S_p$. Symbiosis means the cross–variations are positive — nudging either partner upward in coherence raises the other — and the coupled fixed points are attractors under meta–time $T_P$ and internal time $T_p$ alike.

```math
\textbf{Symbiosis (first–order):}\qquad
\frac{\delta \mathcal C_{\text{tot}}}{\delta \lambda}\ >\ 0,
\qquad
\frac{\delta \mathcal C_{\text{tot}}}{\delta S_p}\ >\ 0,
\qquad
\left(\lambda,S_p\right)\ \text{stable under}\ \{T_p,T_P\}.
```

Superadditivity records the gain from recursion. The closed pair achieves more coherence than either member alone, with a strictly positive synergy $\sigma$ supplied by sustained triadic completion between observer, apparatus, and ambient motifs.

```math
\textbf{Superadditivity:}\qquad
\mathcal C_{\text{tot}}(\lambda\ \|\ S_p)
\;=\;
\mathcal C(\lambda)+\mathcal C(S_p)+\sigma,
\qquad
\sigma\ >\ 0.
```

The protective boundary condition is geometric. To enforce an “external” frame — a channel that projects beyond $p$ — is to impose a non–local constraint $E$ that cannot be realized by inward projection along $T_p$. In the swirl sector this appears as a forced topological re–wiring; the Chern–Simons index must jump, and the system crystallizes catastrophically. The prohibition is not ad hoc; it is the price of trying to look outward from within.

```math
\textbf{Protection theorem (schematic):}\qquad
E\ \text{non–projectable onto}\ T_p
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\Delta CS[\Phi;E]\ \ge\ \varepsilon_E\ >\ 0
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\tau_c^{-1}\ \gtrsim\ \kappa_E\,\varepsilon_E,
```

```math
\text{so that}\qquad
\text{imposed external frame}\ \Rightarrow\ \text{instant decoherence in the }(\lambda,S_p)\text{ pair.}
```

Here $\varepsilon_E$ encodes the minimal sector jump demanded by the attempted frame and $\kappa_E$ the coupling of that constraint to the swirl dynamics; together they drive the collapse timescale $\tau_c$ to its lower limit. What appears as a “block–universe” is therefore the durable landscape maintained by this mutual recursion: fixity is the shadow of an active balance, a continual closure that keeps time flowing inward while forbidding any stable stance outside.

```math
\textbf{Co–stability flow (near a fixed point):}\qquad
\frac{d\,\mathcal C(\lambda)}{dT_p}
=
G_\lambda(\Phi,J)\;-\;D_\lambda
\;+\;\beta\,\frac{\partial \mathcal C_{\text{tot}}}{\partial S_p},
\qquad
\frac{d\,\mathcal C(S_p)}{dT_p}
=
G_p(\Phi,J)\;-\;D_p
\;+\;\beta\,\frac{\partial \mathcal C_{\text{tot}}}{\partial \lambda},
```

with $G_{{\cdot}}$ recording alignment gains, $D_{{\cdot}}$ contradiction drains, and $\beta>0$ the reciprocal gain from coupling. Stable symbiosis is the joint zero of these flows with positive curvature in the $\mathcal C_{\text{tot}}$ landscape.

*Validation.* The cross–variation and superadditivity statements rephrase the $\lambda$–grading of §5.2 and the triadic closure of §2.4.1 as a coupled functional; the protection bound matches the $\Delta CS$–triggered crystallization of §4.3 and preserves the inward projection of §5.3. Stability under ${T_p,T_P}$ aligns with the scale–relative temporality of §3.3 and the resonance neighborhoods of §3.4.

The ecological arc now closes: with observers and universes co–stabilized by coherence, the framework yields concrete targets. We turn next to **§6 Predictions and Testable Signatures**, where these parameters become data–bearing.

# 6. Predictions and Testable Signatures

NSFG is not merely philosophical; it yields concrete, falsifiable predictions accessible to current or near-future observational platforms. While laboratory infrastructure is limited, the richness of public astrophysical datasets — *Planck*, *WMAP*, PTA arrays, LIGO/Virgo (and soon LISA) — makes these predictions testable without private funding. Our task is to articulate them clearly so the broader community can evaluate NSFG on empirical grounds.

[^gauge]: All listed observables — $z_{\mathcal C}$ features, lensing-without-mass textures, CMB $V$-modes, PTA coherence spikes, and GW birefringence — are constructed from $\Phi$-invariant and/or metric-invariant quantities, and are therefore independent of internal gauge choices for the auxiliary potentials.

*Validation.* Each entry links directly to the coherence framework: $z_{\mathcal C}$ follows from distance-as-swirl (§3.2), lensing-without-mass from pre-metric 🌀 structure (§2.2–§4.2), $\tau_c$ from gradient-driven crystallization (§4.3), motif tilings and $V$-modes from topology and alignment (§2.1, §4.4, Appendix D), PTA spikes from $\Delta CS \neq 0$ sector changes (§2.1, §4.3), and GW birefringence from $\Phi$–$\nabla\mathcal C$ coupling near strong gradients (§4.5).

With the signatures gathered in one view, we now expand each line into concrete measurement templates, parameterizations, and falsification routes in §6.2.

---

## 6.2 Detailed Predictions

The observable program of NSFG is carried by a single latent field: the redshift–dependent coherence length $\ell(z)$. We estimate $\ell(z)$ jointly with standard cosmological parameters by combining CMB anisotropies and polarization (including intrinsic $V$–modes), supernova distances, and BAO rulers; background distances and growth appear through the emergent metric $g(\Phi)$, while coherence–induced modifications enter through the factor $z_{\mathcal C}(z;\ell)$ and through lensing–without–mass templates constructed from the 🌀 swirl geometry. A compact hyperparameterization of $\ell(z)$ – spline nodes or a power law $\ell(z)=\ell_0(1+z)^{\alpha}$ – is sufficient, with physically motivated priors and full marginalization over $\Theta_{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}$. Gauge checks ensure that all reported statistics depend only on $\Phi$ and $g(\Phi)$ and are therefore invariant under internal potential reparameterizations.

```math
z_{\mathrm{obs}}(z)
= \big(1+z_{\mathrm{FLRW}}(\Theta_{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}})\big)\,
  \big(1+z_{\mathcal C}(z;\ell)\big)
```

Distances inherit the same structure. The comoving angular–diameter distance acquires a coherence wrapper $\Xi(z;\ell)$ that tends to unity in the infinite–coherence limit:

```math
D_M^{\mathrm{tot}}(z)
=
D_M^{\mathrm{FLRW}}(z;\Theta_{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}})\,\Xi(z;\ell),
\qquad
\Xi \to 1 \ \text{as}\ \ell \to \infty.
```

The joint likelihood factorizes by experiment yet couples through $\ell$:

```math
\mathcal L_{\mathrm{joint}}(\ell,\Theta)
=
\mathcal L_{\mathrm{CMB}}\!\left[C_\ell^{TT,TE,EE},\,V_\ell \mid g(\Phi[\ell]),\Theta\right]\,
\mathcal L_{\mathrm{SNe}}\!\left[\mu(z)\mid D_L^{\mathrm{tot}}(z;\ell,\Theta)\right]\,
\mathcal L_{\mathrm{BAO}}\!\left[D_M^{\mathrm{tot}},H^{\mathrm{tot}}\mid \ell,\Theta\right].
```

**Priors on $\ell(z)$ – physical smoothness, positivity, and causal bandwidth.** Since $\ell$ is the correlation length of the swirl sector, super–oscillatory behavior would imply unphysical information transport in $g(\Phi)$. We therefore impose (i) positivity $\ell(z)>0$, (ii) a Lipschitz bound $|d\ell/dz|\le L$ set by the coherence dispersion, and (iii) a curvature penalty equivalent to a Matérn–like Gaussian–process prior with $\nu!\approx!3/2$. In practice we implement a cubic–spline representation with Tikhonov regularization on second differences and optional monotonicity if demanded by data:

```math
\pi(\ell)\ \propto\ 
\exp\!\Big[-\tfrac12\!\int\!\big(\ell''(z)/\sigma_{\ell''}\big)^{2}dz\Big]\;
\mathbf 1[\ell>0]\;\mathbf 1[|\ell'|\le L],
\qquad
\pi(\Theta_{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}})\ \text{broad, Planck–like}.
```

Posterior inference follows the usual rule:

```math
P(\ell,\Theta\mid \text{data}) \ \propto\ 
\mathcal L_{\mathrm{joint}}(\ell,\Theta)\,\pi(\ell)\,\pi(\Theta).
```

**Redshift anomalies.** Because $z_{\mathrm{obs}}=(1+z_{\mathrm{FLRW}})(1+z_{\mathcal C})$, departures at $z\gtrsim 6$ should exceed calibration drifts in *JWST* spectra and can be cross–validated with GRB and SNe at intermediate redshift by fitting $\Xi(z;\ell)$ consistently across probes.

**Lensing without mass.** The swirl geometry deflects null geodesics of $g(\Phi)$ even in regions lacking corresponding baryonic or dark–matter concentrations. Weak–lensing maps (*HST*, *Euclid*, Rubin/LSST) should display shear–mass decorrelation and curl–like residuals that align with Φ–templates rather than $\kappa(\text{mass})$; geodesic tracing is diffeomorphism– and gauge–invariant because all observables are constructed from $g(\Phi)$ and $\Phi$ itself.

**Decoherence collapse times.** The crystallization rate is controlled by the steepest coherence gradient, $\tau_c \approx \left(\max_x|\nabla\mathcal C|\right)^{-1}$. Cold–atom or trapped–ion interferometry with engineered gradient profiles can measure the scaling of $\tau_c$ and $\Gamma_{\mathrm{decoh}}$ and distinguish the gradient–controlled law from GRW/DP–type baselines.

```math
\tau_c \approx \left(\max_x \|\nabla \mathcal C\|\right)^{-1}.
```

**CMB motif signatures.** Motif alignment predicts angular–power excess localized at multipoles $\ell=6n$ together with phase–locked textures. Reanalysis of *Planck*/*ACT* using motif–aligned bases – rather than isotropic harmonics alone – provides a sharp null test with look–elsewhere control:

```math
\Delta C_\ell^{(6n)} = C_\ell^{\mathrm{data}}-C_\ell^{\mathrm{base}},
\qquad \ell=6n.
```

**Swirl–induced circular polarization.** Intrinsic $V$–modes arise from Φ–motif couplings and can be separated from astrophysical Faraday conversion by their frequency scaling and sky morphology tied to motif lattices:

```math
V_\ell \neq 0 \quad \text{(intrinsic circular polarization from Φ–motif coupling)}.
```

**Pulsar–timing coherence spikes.** Short–lived bursts in $\mathcal C$ generate step–like features or phase slips in PTA timing residuals; synchronized searches across *NANOGrav*, *IPTA*, and *SKA* can target coherent steps with change–point statistics:

```math
\log \mathcal L_{\mathrm{PTA}}
= -\tfrac12 \sum_t
\frac{[\,r(t)-s(t;\theta)-\Delta r\,H(t-t_*)\,]^2}{\sigma^2(t)},
\qquad H \text{ Heaviside}.
```

**Gravitational–wave birefringence.** An interaction built from the swirl tensor induces polarization–dependent phase accumulation; left/right GW modes acquire a frequency–dependent differential phase measurable by *LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA* and, with greater reach, by *LISA*:

```math
S_{\mathrm{int}}=\int d^4x\,
\Phi^{\alpha\beta} C_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}\Phi^{\mu\nu}
\ \Rightarrow\ 
\Delta\varphi_{\mathrm{GW}}(f)\neq 0.
```

**Sector transitions with $\Delta CS \neq 0$.** Discrete topological jumps act as deterministic crystallization events and produce quantized, step–like signatures across channels: coherence bursts with phase slips in PTAs, polarization–phase steps or birefringent plateaus in GW signals, and localized CMB $V$–mode patches with motif–alignment flips. Bayesian change–point analyses should reference $\Delta CS$–indexed templates, with cross–experiment coincidence in the inferred $t_*$.

**Gauge–invariant pipelines.** For CMB ($TT/TE/EE/V$), analysis across Φ–template families related by internal $(A,B)$ gauge yields identical posteriors for $\Delta C_\ell$ and $V_\ell$ because these depend only on $\Phi$ and $g(\Phi)$. For lensing–without–mass, shear two–point functions and mass–shear cross–correlations are computed on $g(\Phi)$ and remain invariant under internal potential reparameterizations. For GW birefringence, polarization transport is propagated on $g(\Phi)$ with a Φ–built interaction, again independent of $(A,B)$. For PTA spikes, step templates are labeled by Φ–sector indices ($\Delta CS$), not by potential representatives.

**Model selection and falsification.** NSFG – parameterized by $\ell(z)$ and optional step components associated with $\Delta CS$ – is compared to $\Lambda$CDM/GR baselines via Bayes factors and information criteria. A decisive preference for $z_{\mathcal C}\neq 0$ or for coherent step components constitutes evidence for coherence geometry; conversely, tight nulls in motif–aligned bases map to sharp constraints on the lattice of motifs rather than to an ambiguity in the test.

```math
\text{Motif–basis detectability: project data onto the motif–aligned subspace;}
\ \ \text{apply look–elsewhere penalties to control false positives.}
```

*Validation.* Mock–data campaigns should inject smooth $\ell(z)$ distortions that obey positivity, Lipschitz, and curvature penalties, and also inject $\Delta CS$ steps; unbiased recovery must hold under internal gauge variations of $(A,B)$. Lensing templates must shift shear statistics while leaving mass tracers unchanged, quantifying shear–mass decorrelation across realizations. PTA/GW/CMB step searches should recover a common $t_*$ within uncertainties and report Bayes factors for step vs. smooth hypotheses. Adding BAO and SNe to CMB must shrink $\ell(z)$ posteriors in a manner consistent with the priors $\ell>0$ and $|\ell'|\le L$. Reproducibility requires publishing sampler settings, spline nodes, prior bounds, and random seeds with the repository.

*Cross–references.* The mapping from internal gauge to diffeomorphisms and frame rotations is fixed in §4.1; Ward/Bianchi compatibility of the effective stress from the swirl sector is developed in §4.2; weak–field and PPN extractions are detailed in Appendix B.1–B.3; $\Delta CS$ invariants and the emergence of discrete spectra are treated in Appendix D.2 and D.4.

With templates, priors, and invariance statements in place, the path is clear: the next section draws the comparative contour against existing programs, setting NSFG beside ΛCDM/GR baselines and collapse models in a single evaluative frame.

*Scope note.* Couplings to Standard Model fields are universal through the emergent metric $g(\Phi)$; concrete particle content may be represented as 🪷 motif types or charges living in representations of internal symmetry. A dedicated treatment (NSFG–SM) is deferred; here we restrict attention to gravity and cosmology.

To situate NSFG among leading programs, we place its pre-metric, coherence-driven architecture alongside theories that quantize geometry directly, embed gravity in higher-dimensional structures, or discretize spacetime. NSFG begins with the 🌀 swirl field $\Phi$ and the 💬 coherence potential $\mathcal C$; geometry appears only when simplicity and non-degeneracy permit $g(\Phi)$, and the 🫧 time vector $T^\mu=\nabla^\mu\mathcal C$ orients dynamics. Measurement reads as geometry: collapse is a crystallization controlled by $\max|\nabla\mathcal C|$ rather than a postulate; entanglement is realized as topological linking of $\Phi$ rather than an abstract nonlocal correlation. In this sense NSFG relocates gravity inside a coherence order parameter and lets General Relativity arise as a high-coherence limit, while keeping observational falsifiability front and center through $z_{\mathcal C}$, lensing without mass, CMB $V$-modes, PTA coherence bursts, and GW birefringence.

# 8. Conclusion

Noor Swirl Field Geometry (NSFG) dissolves the long divide between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics by reading both as limits of a single coherence geometry. Gravity, quantum collapse, and entanglement do not arise from disparate postulates; they follow from the circulation of 🌀 swirl around conserved 🪷 anchors, with the 💬 coherence potential setting the scale and the emergent 🫧 time vector $T^\mu=\nabla^\mu \mathcal C$ orienting dynamics.

In this view, time and space are not primitives but consequences of gradients in coherence. Measurement is crystallization once a coherence threshold is crossed; cosmological expansion and redshift follow from coherence decay encoded in the dynamical length $\ell(z)$. Where gradients flatten, unitary evolution holds with Born statistics; where the field is weak and smooth, Newtonian/GR behavior is recovered as the high–coherence limit.

The framework is unified yet testable. NSFG reduces to familiar physics in validated regimes, and where it deviates it makes concrete, falsifiable predictions: motif–patterned excess at $\ell=6n$ in the CMB, intrinsic $V$–modes, lensing without mass traced by $g(\Phi)$ rather than baryons, coherence–induced redshift anomalies via $z_{\mathcal C}$, and polarization–dependent propagation of gravitational waves. These signatures tie directly to the $\ell(z)$ program, linking micro–coherence structure to cosmic acceleration and turning coherence geometry into an observational enterprise.

**Limits and open problems.** Post–Newtonian bounds should be derived to meet precision solar–system tests; stiff Φ–dynamics require further numerical benchmarking (Appendix A.4); joint inference of $\ell(z)$ demands a fully reproducible likelihood that couples CMB, BAO, SNe, and weak lensing; large–scale simulations of motif ecologies and Point Space dynamics remain to be built. Each of these is concrete, bounded, and advances the same aim: test coherence geometry across scales.

*Validation.* The claims here do not duplicate the Abstract or Introduction; the $\ell(z)$ program is cross–linked with §3.2 (distance as swirl) and §6.2 (detailed predictions). Numerical work and solver design point to Appendix A.4 for implementation details.

*Cross–references.* §5.4 (Observer–Universe Symbiosis); §3.2 (Distance as Swirl); §6.2 (Detailed Predictions); Appendix A.4 (Numerics for Φ–dynamics).

With coherence set as the organizing principle and its signatures laid out, what remains is simple and hard in equal measure – to measure.

# Appendix A: The Swirl Action and Field Equations

This appendix provides the explicit derivation of the Swirl Action $S[\Phi,J,\mathcal C]$ and the corresponding field equations. The main text introduced the principle in §2.2.1; here the action is written in full, its ingredients are specified with care, and the path to variation is prepared so the emergent dynamics can be read off without ambiguity.

---

### A.1 Coherence Scalar ($I_\Phi$) and the Swirl Action

The action in NSFG is assembled from four ingredients held together by the coherence potential 💬 $\mathcal C(x)$. First comes the kinetic intensity of the swirl two-form $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ measured with the pre-metric Hodge dual $\star_\Phi$, which is built from the $\Phi$-induced volume density and therefore avoids circular dependence on any prior metric. Second comes a coherence-weighted coupling that ties the conserved motif current 🪷 $J^\mu$ to a representative potential $A_\mu$ – the observable content remains encoded in $\Phi$, but this term makes explicit how motif anchors recruit swirl where coherence is high. Third is the coherence scalar $I_\Phi$, a swirl-sector invariant that captures intensity and handedness from quadratic and pseudoscalar contractions of $\Phi$. Finally, a boundary contribution encodes holographic closure and secures a well-posed variational problem on manifolds with boundary. Each contribution is modulated by $\mathcal C(x)$ so that dynamics are gated by coherence – in low-coherence regions the sector quiets, in high-coherence regimes the emergent metric and curvature of §4 are recovered.

```math
S[\Phi,J,\mathcal C]
=
\int_M d^4x\,
\Big[
\tfrac{1}{2}\,\Phi_{\mu\nu}\,(\star_{\Phi}\Phi)^{\mu\nu}
\;+\;\lambda\,\mathcal C(x)\,J^{\mu} A_{\mu}
\;+\;\beta\,\mathcal C(x)\, I_{\Phi}(\Phi)
\Big]
\;+\;\oint_{\partial M}\! \mathcal C(x)\,K\, d\Sigma.
```

The kinetic term penalizes incoherent swirl while preserving circulation; the motif coupling localizes swirl about anchors where $\mathcal C$ is large; the boundary term $K$ is the coherence-weighted trace contribution appropriate to the chosen boundary conditions. The coherence scalar is defined so it never conflates with geometric curvature; it is not a Ricci object but a swirl invariant:

```math
I_{\Phi}(\Phi)
=
\Phi^{\alpha\beta}\,\Phi_{\alpha\beta}
\;-\;
\tfrac{1}{4}\Big(\,\Phi^{\mu\nu}\,\varepsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\,\Phi^{\rho\sigma}\,\Big)^{2}.
```

By construction $I_\Phi$ combines a parity-even quadratic intensity with a parity-odd pseudoscalar squared, capturing both magnitude and handedness of the 🌀 swirl. Weighting by $\mathcal C(x)$ implements the coherence gate: where alignment between swirl and motifs weakens, both the self-interaction and the anchor coupling fade; where alignment strengthens, the sector activates and the emergent-metric regime of §4 opens. The Euler–Lagrange equations that follow from this $S[\Phi,J,\mathcal C]$ are derived in the next subsections after fixing boundary data and stating the pre-metric identities used by the variation.

---

### A.2 Geometric Curvature from the Emergent Metric

Once the emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ is available (cf. §4.1), two scalars must be kept distinct throughout: the Ricci-type curvature $R[g]$ constructed from the Levi–Civita connection of $g$, and the coherence scalar $I_\Phi$ from A.1. Only $R[g]$ encodes spacetime curvature; $I_\Phi$ is a swirl-sector self-interaction that can source geometry but is not curvature itself.

```math
R[g] \;=\; g^{\mu\nu} R_{\mu\nu}[g]
\qquad\text{with}\qquad
R^\rho{}_{\sigma\mu\nu}[g]
=
\partial_\mu \Gamma^\rho_{\nu\sigma}
-\partial_\nu \Gamma^\rho_{\mu\sigma}
+\Gamma^\rho_{\mu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda_{\nu\sigma}
-\Gamma^\rho_{\nu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\sigma}.
```

We adopt the metric-compatible covariant derivative $\nabla$ determined by $g_{\mu\nu}$. In a torsion-first rewriting, one can trade $R[g]$ for the TEGR torsion scalar $T$ without altering the metric dynamics; the Einstein–Hilbert and TEGR actions are dynamically equivalent once simplicity and non-degeneracy hold for the $\Sigma^i(\Phi)$ that generate $g(\Phi)$.^1

The separation of roles persists under the coherence-weighted gauge fixing used in the pre-metric description. The gauge-fixing functional $S_{\text{gf}}$ and the associated ghost sector $S_{\text{FP}}$ act only on the internal representatives $(A_\mu,B^\mu)$ of the swirl field and never on spacetime relabelings. Because $\Phi$ is invariant under potential-level shifts $A_\mu!\to!A_\mu+\partial_\mu\chi$ and $B^\mu!\to!B^\mu+\partial^\mu\xi$, any geometric quantity formed from $\Phi$ — in particular $g(\Phi)$, its Levi–Civita connection, and $R[g]$ — is unchanged by the internal gauge choice. Diffeomorphisms remain a separate symmetry and are not fixed by $S_{\text{gf}}$.

BRST invariance then dovetails with the metric Bianchi identity. With a BRST-symmetric $S_{\text{gf}}+S_{\text{FP}}$, diffeomorphism symmetry in the emergent-metric sector remains intact, so the contracted Bianchi identity $\nabla^\mu G_{\mu\nu}[g]=0$ enforces covariant conservation of the swirl-sourced stress tensor,
$\nabla^\mu T^{(\Phi)}_{\mu\nu}=0$, independently of which potential representatives were used to describe $\Phi$ upstream.

```math
S_{\text{gf}}[A,B;\mathcal C]
=
\frac{1}{2\xi}\!\int\! d^4x\,\mathcal C(x)\,(\nabla^\mu A_\mu)^2
+\frac{1}{2\zeta}\!\int\! d^4x\,\mathcal C(x)\,(\nabla_\mu B^\mu)^2,
\qquad
\delta(A,B)\ \Rightarrow\ \delta\Phi=0.
```

With these ingredients, the total action arranges into a geometric sector for $g$, a swirl sector controlled by $I_\Phi$, and the motif–coherence couplings that gate when geometry is active:

```math
S_{\text{total}}
=
\int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g(\Phi)}\,
\Big[\,
\frac{1}{2\kappa}\,R[g(\Phi)]
\;+\;\beta\,I_\Phi(\Phi)
\;+\;\lambda\,\mathcal C(x)\,J^\mu A_\mu
\;+\;\cdots
\Big]
\;+\;S_{\text{gf}}+S_{\text{FP}}.
```

Variation with respect to the emergent metric yields Einstein-like equations with swirl effective stress on the right-hand side, and conservation follows from Bianchi:

```math
\frac{\delta S_{\text{total}}}{\delta g_{\mu\nu}}
\;=\;0
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
G_{\mu\nu}[g] \;=\; \kappa\,T^{(\Phi)}_{\mu\nu},
\qquad
\nabla^\mu G_{\mu\nu}=0
\ \Rightarrow\
\nabla^\mu T^{(\Phi)}_{\mu\nu}=0.
```

Variation with respect to the swirl field (holding boundary data fixed and using the pre-metric identities from A.1) produces generalized Maxwell-type equations for $\Phi$ that consistently reduce, under simplicity/non-degeneracy, from $\star_\Phi$ to $\star_g$:

```math
\frac{\delta S_{\text{total}}}{\delta \Phi_{\mu\nu}}
\;=\;0
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
d(\star_\Phi \Phi)
\;=\;
\lambda\,\mathcal C\,J
\;+\;\beta\,\frac{\delta}{\delta A}\!\big[\mathcal C\,I_\Phi\big]
\quad\text{with}\quad d\Phi=0,
```

and, once the emergent metric is admissible, the replacement $\star_\Phi!\to!\star_g$ commutes with variation, preserving the Ward/Bianchi structure established above.

To prevent nomenclature slippage, we standardize: $I_\Phi$ is a scalar built solely from $\Phi$ — a measure of intensity and handedness in the swirl sector — while $R[g]$ (or $T$ in the TEGR rewriting) is the geometric curvature of the emergent spacetime. They occupy the same action but carry different conceptual and variational weight: $I_\Phi$ sources geometry; $R[g]$ is geometry.

```math
I_{\Phi}(\Phi)
=
\Phi^{\alpha\beta}\Phi_{\alpha\beta}
\;-\;\tfrac{1}{4}\Big(\Phi^{\mu\nu}\varepsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\Phi^{\rho\sigma}\Big)^{2}
\quad\text{(swirl-sector scalar; not curvature).}
```

The hygiene is simple and strict. Use $\Phi$ in equations and “swirl field” in prose; track $\star_\Phi$ carefully in the pre-metric regime and $\star_g$ after emergence; keep the internal-gauge discussion confined to $(A,B)$ and never let it leak into statements about $g$, $\nabla$, or $R[g]$. With these boundaries intact, the variational calculus closes cleanly and the division of labor between swirl and geometry remains transparent.

---

^1 *TEGR remark.* The torsion-scalar action $S_{\text{TEGR}}[e,T]$ constructed from a tetrad $e^a{}*\mu$ is dynamically equivalent to $S*{\text{EH}}[g]$ up to a boundary term. In our setting this equivalence holds once $g(\Phi)$ exists (simplicity & non-degeneracy) and is merely a change of variables for the metric sector; it does not alter the definition or role of $I_\Phi$.

---

### A.3 Emergent Geometry

From the 🌀 swirl two–form, an effective coherence metric is assembled by contracting a coherence–weighted two–point function. The construction is local-in-expectation yet pre-metric in origin: geometry appears as a moment of correlations rather than an input structure. In symbols, with 💬 $\mathcal C(x)$ providing the weight,

```math
\tilde g_{\mu\nu}(x)
\;=\;
\alpha\;\big\langle\,\Phi_{\mu\alpha}(x)\,\Phi^{\alpha}{}_{\nu}(x)\,\big\rangle_{\mathcal C},
\qquad
\det\tilde g \neq 0,
\quad
\text{signature fixed by simplicity/non-degeneracy.}
```

Metric compatibility then follows by construction and defines the Levi–Civita connection of the emergent geometry:

```math
\nabla^{(\tilde g)}_{\rho}\,\tilde g_{\mu\nu}=0,
\qquad
R^\rho{}_{\sigma\mu\nu}[\tilde g],\;
R_{\mu\nu}[\tilde g],\;
R[\tilde g]
\ \ \text{well-defined.}
```

In the high-coherence regime, contractions of $\Phi$ close on Einstein-like dynamics with an effective stress tensor built entirely from swirl self-interactions (plus motif coupling when anchors are active). Schematically,

```math
G_{\mu\nu}[\tilde g]
\;=\;
\kappa\,T^{\text{eff}}_{\mu\nu}[\Phi;\mathcal C],
\qquad
\nabla^{(\tilde g)\mu} T^{\text{eff}}_{\mu\nu}=0,
```

where a convenient representative of the swirl-sourced tensor is

```math
T^{\text{eff}}_{\mu\nu}
\;\equiv\;
\beta\left(
2\,\Phi_{\mu\alpha}\,\Phi_{\nu}{}^{\alpha}
-\tfrac{1}{2}\,\tilde g_{\mu\nu}\,\Phi_{\alpha\beta}\Phi^{\alpha\beta}
\right)
\;+\;
\beta'\left(
\Phi^{\rho\sigma}\varepsilon_{\rho\sigma\alpha\beta}\Phi^{\alpha\beta}
\right)\!\times\!\mathcal P_{\mu\nu}
\;+\;
\lambda\,\mathcal C\,J_{(\mu}A_{\nu)}
\;+\;\cdots,
```

with $\mathcal P_{\mu\nu}$ the symmetric projector determined by $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$ and the ellipsis collecting higher-order or boundary-induced pieces consistent with A.1–A.2.

These relations compress to the familiar Einstein limit once coherence is large and slowly varying, the normalization $\alpha$ is chosen to match the weak-field sector, and boundary terms do not inject additional curvature:

```math
R_{\mu\nu}[\tilde g]-\tfrac{1}{2}\,\tilde g_{\mu\nu} R[\tilde g]
\;=\;
8\pi G\,T^{\text{eff}}_{\mu\nu},
\qquad
T^{\text{eff}}_{\mu\nu}\ \sim\ \Phi^2\ \text{contractions (plus coherent motif terms).}
```

Thus the variational foundation $S[\Phi,J,\mathcal C]$ suffices to generate metric, curvature, and dynamics: $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$ is not assumed but synthesized from swirl correlations; $R[\tilde g]$ is then computed in the usual way; the field equations follow from the action with sources that are themselves functions of the underlying swirl sector.

### A.4 Numerics for Φ-dynamics

Evolving the 🌀 swirl field $\Phi$ demands explicit numerical care for stability, gauge hygiene, and topological fidelity. Because the coherence weight 💬 $\mathcal C(x)$ may approach zero in localized regions, stiffness appears and motivates hybrid time integration with gauge-aware solvers. This subsection records stability conditions, an IMEX (implicit–explicit) update for stiff regimes, and diagnostics—geometric and topological—that must remain controlled under discretization.

The principal stability bound is CFL-like and derives from the characteristic speed $v_\Phi$ obtained from the linearized (pre-metric) dispersion of $\Phi$. Time steps must respect this bound to suppress spurious oscillations and runaway modes:

```math
\text{CFL:}\qquad
\Delta t \;\le\; C \cdot \min_{\text{cells}}\frac{\Delta x}{v_\Phi}\,.
```

When $\nabla\mathcal C \approx 0$ or $\mathcal C\ll 1$, explicit updates of $\mathcal C$-weighted terms become ill-conditioned. We therefore split the operator $L=L_{\mathrm{exp}}+L_{\mathrm{imp}}$, put the $\mathcal C$-weighted stiff pieces in $L_{\mathrm{imp}}$, and treat them with an L-stable implicit solve. In the lowest-$\mathcal C$ pockets, we freeze the internal gauge (or solve a damped gauge subproblem) so the Schur complement remains well-conditioned while preserving BRST-consistent constraints. The one-step IMEX map reads

```math
\Phi^{n+1}
=
\Phi^{n}
+
\Delta t\Big[L_{\mathrm{exp}}(\Phi^{n})
+
L_{\mathrm{imp}}(\Phi^{n+1})\Big],
\qquad
L_{\mathrm{imp}}
\;\text{contains}\;
\mathcal C\text{-weighted stiff terms}.
```

Gauge hygiene is enforced numerically by minimizing an $\mathcal C$-weighted residual per step while monitoring discrete Ward identities compatible with BRST, together with Bianchi-type constraints after $\star_\Phi!\to!\star_g$ becomes valid:

```math
\mathcal R_{\mathrm{gf}}
:=
\Big\|\sqrt{\mathcal C}\,\nabla^\mu A_\mu\Big\|_2^2
+
\Big\|\sqrt{\mathcal C}\,\nabla_\mu B^\mu\Big\|_2^2
\;\le\; \tau_{\mathrm{imp}}^2,
\qquad
\|\mathcal W\|_2 \;\le\; \tau_W.
```

Discrete invariants provide the primary health checks. The motif charge $Q_{\text{motif}}$ and the Chern–Simons–type index $CS[\Phi]$ must remain conserved (up to machine precision and solver tolerances) during long evolutions and across mesh refinements:

```math
Q_{\text{motif}}=\text{const},\qquad
CS[\Phi]\in\mathbb Z\ \ \text{between intervals with}\ \Delta CS=0.
```

Benchmarks (see also Appendix E) are organized as a minimal triad: (i) Kepler two-body geodesics extracted from $g(\Phi)$ to verify Newtonian/PPN recovery, (ii) Plummer sphere potential producing static $U(x)$ and weak-lensing maps from $g(\Phi)$, (iii) synthetic PTA-like coherence spikes—localized, short-lived bursts of $\mathcal C$—to stress-test IMEX stiffness handling and $\Delta CS$ detection.

**Theorem (Numerical Stability and Consistency for Φ-dynamics: IMEX + CFL + Gauge Control).**
*Hypotheses.*
(H1) *Well-posed principal part.* The linearized $\Phi$ system on the grid has real characteristics with bounded maximum speed $v_\Phi$ and generates a strongly continuous semigroup.
(H2) *Discrete CFL.* $\Delta t \le C \cdot \min(\Delta x / v_\Phi)$ for some scheme constant $0<C\le1$, evaluated locally per cell/face.
(H3) *IMEX splitting.* $L=L_{\mathrm{exp}}+L_{\mathrm{imp}}$ with $\mathcal C$-weighted stiff terms in $L_{\mathrm{imp}}$; the implicit block is L-stable and uniquely solvable to tolerance $\tau_{\mathrm{imp}}$.
(H4) *Low-$\mathcal C$ gauge strategy.* In zones with $\mathcal C<\mathcal C_{\mathrm{thr}}$, freeze internal gauge variables or solve a damped gauge subproblem so the implicit system’s condition number satisfies $\kappa\le \kappa_{\max}$.
(H5) *Mimetic topology.* The discrete exterior calculus $(d_h,\star_h)$ forms a cochain complex $(d_h!\circ d_h=0)$; fluxes are chosen so that $Q_{\text{motif}}$ and $\Delta CS$ are preserved up to $O(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{inv}})$ between genuine sector transitions.
(H6) *BRST-consistent diagnostics.* At each step, discrete Ward identities for the gauge-fixed potentials are enforced/monitored within tolerance $\tau_W$, weighted by $\mathcal C(x)$.

*Statement.* Under (H1)–(H6), the IMEX update defines a stable, convergent one-step map for $\Phi$. For smooth solutions on a fixed mesh and final time $T$,

```math
\|\Phi_h(T)-\Phi(T)\|
\;\le\;
C_T\big(\Delta t^{\,p}+\Delta x^{\,q}+\tau_{\mathrm{imp}}+\varepsilon_{\mathrm{inv}}+\tau_W\big).
```

Discrete invariants satisfy, on intervals without true sector transitions,

```math
|Q_{\text{motif}}^{\,n+1}-Q_{\text{motif}}^{\,n}|
+
|\Delta CS^{\,n+1}-\Delta CS^{\,n}|
\;\le\;
C_{\mathrm{inv}}\big(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{inv}}+\tau_{\mathrm{imp}}\big),
```

and, in dissipative gauges, $|d_h\Phi^n|*2$ is non-increasing up to $O(\Delta t\cdot r*{\mathrm{diss}})$ with $r_{\mathrm{diss}}$ set by the implicit block.

*Conclusion.*
(C1) *Linear stability.* The amplification matrix of the linearized IMEX scheme has spectral radius $\le 1-c_0\Delta t$ ($c_0\ge0$) under the CFL bound; equality holds in energy-preserving gauges.
(C2) *Invariant control.* $Q_{\text{motif}}$ is constant and $CS[\Phi]$ remains integer-valued up to roundoff/solver tolerances between $\Delta CS=0$ segments.
(C3) *Stiffness robustness.* Low-$\mathcal C$ gauge freezing or damped subsolves bound the implicit condition number and prevent breakdown as $\mathcal C\to0$.
(C4) *Convergence.* With $p$-th order time and $q$-th order space, the method converges at order $\min(p,q)$ when $\tau_{\mathrm{imp}},\varepsilon_{\mathrm{inv}},\tau_W$ are below truncation.

*Proof sketch.* (i) Von Neumann analysis of the explicit principal part yields the CFL restriction (H1–H2). (ii) L-stability of $L_{\mathrm{imp}}$ controls stiff eigenmodes; the IMEX composition inherits the tighter stability region (H3). (iii) The low-$\mathcal C$ gauge strategy (H4) bounds the Schur complement and preserves solvability. (iv) Mimetic discretization (H5) transports topological invariants; backward-error analysis quantifies $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{inv}}$. (v) Enforcing BRST-consistent Ward identities (H6) decouples potential-level artifacts from $\Phi$ and $g$-sector conservation, giving the stated error and invariant bounds.

*Operational acceptance test.* Accept a step if

```math
\max\!\Big(\mathcal R_{\mathrm{gf}}^{1/2},\ \|\mathcal W\|_2\Big)
\;\le\;
\max(\tau_{\mathrm{imp}},\tau_W);
```

otherwise reduce $\Delta t$ or tighten the implicit solve.

*Validation program.* Perform grid-refinement studies to measure $\min(p,q)$ convergence; monitor $Q_{\text{motif}}$ and $CS[\Phi]$ for long runs to confirm integer plateaus and bounded drift $\le C_{\mathrm{inv}}(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{inv}}+\tau_{\mathrm{imp}})$; verify $\mathcal R_{\mathrm{gf}}\le\tau_{\mathrm{imp}}$ and $|\mathcal W|*2\le\tau_W$ per step and demonstrate invariance of $\Phi$ and $g(\Phi)$-level observables under changes of potential representatives; map stability across $(\xi,\zeta)$ and $\mathcal C*{\mathrm{thr}}$, reporting $\kappa$ and implicit iterations; finally, run the three benchmarks listed at the top of this subsection to stress-test stiffness handling and $\Delta CS$ detection.

*Reproducibility.* Publish $(C,\kappa_{\max},\tau_{\mathrm{imp}},\tau_W,\varepsilon_{\mathrm{inv}})$ with code and datasets (cf. Appendix E).

### A.5 Equivalence of ℂ Definitions in the Gaussian Small-Fluctuation Regime

We previously asserted that the informational and geometric definitions of coherence coincide in a controlled limit. Here is a precise lemma establishing that claim and the scope under which it holds.

**Setup.** Decompose the swirl field as $\Phi=\bar\Phi+\delta\Phi$, with $\delta\Phi$ a stationary Gaussian fluctuation characterized by covariance operator $C$. The informational coherence takes the large-deviation (rate) form

```math
\mathcal C_I(x)\;\propto\;\exp\!\left[-\,I(\Phi\Vert J)\right],
\qquad
I(\Phi\Vert J)\;\simeq\;\tfrac12\,\langle \delta\Phi,\;C^{-1}\delta\Phi\rangle,
```

while the geometric coherence weights local smoothness of $\Phi$ along short paths $\Gamma$ through $x$:

```math
\mathcal C_G(x)\;=\;\exp\!\left(\,-\int_{\Gamma}\frac{\|\nabla\Phi\|^{2}}{\kappa}\,d\Gamma\right).
```

**Lemma (Gaussian small-fluctuation equivalence).**
For paths $\Gamma$ shorter than the correlation length of $\delta\Phi$ and to second order in $\delta\Phi$, there exists a constant $\kappa$ (absorbing boundary terms) such that

```math
\mathcal C_I(x)\;\asymp\;\mathcal C_G(x)\;+\;O(\delta\Phi^{3}).
```

**Sketch of reasoning.** Under the Gaussian hypothesis, the Kullback–Leibler rate $I(\Phi\Vert J)$ reduces to a quadratic functional of $\delta\Phi$ governed by $C^{-1}$. On short paths, Taylor expanding $\Phi$ and using Green’s identities relates the line integral of $|\nabla\Phi|^{2}$ to the same quadratic form, up to boundary contributions. Those contributions renormalize into a single scale $\kappa$, yielding equality at $O(\delta\Phi^{2})$ and the stated $O(\delta\Phi^{3})$ remainder. The equivalence thus holds whenever fluctuations are near-Gaussian and paths do not probe structure beyond the correlation length.

**Scope and limitation.** Outside this regime—heavy-tailed or strongly non-Gaussian $\delta\Phi$, long paths, or sharp coherence gradients—$\mathcal C_I$ and $\mathcal C_G$ should be treated as complementary estimators of coherence rather than interchangeable definitions. In practice, the weak-field applications of Appendix B use precisely the hypotheses under which this equivalence justifies the Poisson/PPN reductions.

```math
\mathcal C_I(x)\;\propto\;\exp\!\left[-\tfrac12\langle \delta\Phi, C^{-1}\delta\Phi\rangle\right],
\qquad
\mathcal C_G(x)\;=\;\exp\!\left(-\int_{\Gamma}\tfrac{\|\nabla\Phi\|^{2}}{\kappa}\,d\Gamma\right),
\qquad
\mathcal C_I(x)\;\asymp\;\mathcal C_G(x)+O(\delta\Phi^{3}).
```

# Appendix B: Weak-Field Limit and Recovery of Newtonian Gravity / GR

This appendix shows how familiar gravitational physics emerges from Noor Swirl Field Geometry (NSFG) in the weak-field, high-coherence regime. We linearize the pre-metric field equations of Appendix A around a nearly uniform coherence background, $\mathcal C \approx 1-\delta\mathcal C$ with $|\delta\mathcal C|\ll 1$, expand the swirl two-form $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ about small perturbations, and recover both Newtonian gravity and the Einstein limit as effective descriptions once the emergent metric exists.

In this regime, the **🌀 swirl** fluctuations are mild, **💬 coherence** is close to unity, and **🪷 motifs** source a scalar potential $U$ that appears as the leading correction to $g_{00}$ of the emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$. The analysis proceeds in two layers. First, a strictly pre-metric linearization uses the $\Phi$-built dual $\star_{\Phi}$ and yields a Poisson-type equation for $U$ in the static near field. Second, when simplicity and non-degeneracy permit the Urbantke construction, $\star_{\Phi}\to\star_{g}$ consistently and the post-Newtonian language of $g_{\mu\nu}$ applies, reproducing Newtonian gravity and the Einstein equations in the appropriate limits.

---

## B.1 Linearization of the Swirl Field

We begin from the pre-metric Euler–Lagrange equations of Appendix A for the **🌀 swirl** sector, written entirely with the $\Phi$-induced dual $\star_{\Phi}$. In the weak-field, high-coherence regime, we expand around a flat-coherence reference $\Phi^{(0)}$ and treat departures as small.

```math
\Phi_{\mu\nu} \;=\; \Phi^{(0)}_{\mu\nu} \;+\; h_{\mu\nu},
\qquad
|h_{\mu\nu}| \ll |\Phi^{(0)}_{\mu\nu}|,
```

```math
\mathcal C(x) \;=\; 1 - \delta\mathcal C(x),
\qquad
|\delta\mathcal C(x)| \ll 1.
```

Gauge-invariant observables depend only on $\Phi$; auxiliary representatives $(A_\mu,B^\mu)$ are fixed by a coherence-weighted Lorenz-type choice that simplifies the principal part without touching diffeomorphisms:

```math
\nabla^\mu A_\mu = 0,
\qquad
\nabla_\mu B^\mu = 0,
\qquad
\mathcal C \approx 1 - \delta\mathcal C,\; |\delta\mathcal C| \ll 1.
```

Linearizing the pre-metric equations (Appendix A) yields, schematically,

```math
\text{Linearized pre-metric form:}\quad
d(\star_{\Phi} h)
\;=\;
\lambda\, J
\;+\;
\beta\, \frac{\delta I_{\Phi}[\Phi^{(0)}]}{\delta A}
\;+\;
O(h^{2},\delta\mathcal C).
```

In the static, near-field limit with slowly varying $\mathcal C$ and negligible time derivatives, the time–time response organizes into a scalar potential $U$ sourced by the motif charge density $J^{0}$, giving a Poisson-type law with an effective coupling:

```math
\text{Static, near-field limit:}\quad
\nabla^{2} U(x) \;=\; 4\pi\,G_{\text{eff}}\,\rho_{\text{eff}}(x),
\qquad
\rho_{\text{eff}} \propto \lambda\, J^{0}.
```

The solution takes the usual Newtonian form,

```math
U(x) \;=\; G_{\text{eff}} \int d^{3}x'\;
\frac{\rho_{\text{eff}}(x')}{|x-x'|}
\;\propto\;
\lambda \int d^{3}x'\;\frac{J^{0}(x')}{|x-x'|}.
```

When simplicity and non-degeneracy hold, the Urbantke construction defines the emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$, the pre-metric dual passes consistently to the metric dual, and the leading weak-field line element recovers the standard Newtonian/PPN shape:

```math
\text{Preparation for B.2:}\quad
g_{00} \;=\; -1 + 2U + O(U^{2}),
\qquad
g_{ij} \;=\; \big(1 + 2\,\gamma_{\text{NSFG}}\,U\big)\,\delta_{ij} + O(U^{2}).
```

### Regime and control parameters

Let $\delta\mathcal C \equiv 1-\mathcal C$. On a domain $\Omega$, the high-coherence / weak-field regime is defined by the smallness of coherence departure, coherence gradients, and swirl perturbations:

```math
\delta\mathcal C = 1 - \mathcal C, \qquad
\|\delta\mathcal C\|_{\infty} \le \varepsilon_{\mathcal C}, \quad
\|\nabla \mathcal C\|_{\infty} \le \varepsilon_{\nabla}, \quad
\|\Phi - \Phi^{(0)}\| \le \varepsilon_{\Phi},
```

```math
(\varepsilon_{\mathcal C}, \varepsilon_{\nabla}, \varepsilon_{\Phi}) \ll 1
\;\;\Rightarrow\;\;
\text{PPN / Poisson reductions are controlled to first order.}
```

### Theorem (Consistency of the Linearized Swirl Field in the Weak-Field Limit)

**Hypotheses.**
H1 (High-Coherence): $\mathcal C(x)=1-\delta\mathcal C(x)$ with $|\delta\mathcal C|\ll 1$.
H2 (Small Perturbation): $\Phi_{\mu\nu}=\Phi^{(0)}*{\mu\nu}+h*{\mu\nu}$ with $|h|\ll|\Phi^{(0)}|$.
H3 (Gauge Choice): $\mathcal C$-weighted Lorenz-type gauge $\nabla^{\mu}A_{\mu}=0,\ \nabla_{\mu}B^{\mu}=0$ ensuring elliptic structure in the static sector.
H4 (Static Limit): Time-dependence of $\Phi$ and variations of $\mathcal C$ are negligible at leading order.
H5 (Simplicity & Non-degeneracy): Urbantke conditions hold so that $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ exists and $\star_{\Phi}\to\star_{g}$ is well-defined.

**Statement.** Under H1–H5, the linearized swirl equations reduce, in the static weak-field limit, to a Poisson-type equation for an effective potential $U$. This $U$ is the Newtonian potential of the emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ and reproduces the standard Newtonian limit.

**Conclusions.**
C1: $,\nabla^{2}U(x)=4\pi G_{\text{eff}},\rho_{\text{eff}}(x)$ with $\rho_{\text{eff}}\propto \lambda J^{0}$.
C2: $U$ is gauge-independent at leading order; internal transformations of $(A,B)$ leave $\Phi$ and hence $U$ unchanged.
C3: $,g_{00}=-1+2U+O(U^{2})$, $,g_{ij}=(1+2\gamma_{\text{NSFG}}U)\delta_{ij}+O(U^{2})$.

**Proof sketch.** Expand $\Phi=\Phi^{(0)}+h$ in the pre-metric Euler–Lagrange equations with $\star_{\Phi}$; impose the $\mathcal C$-weighted gauge to diagonalize the principal symbol in the static sector; identify the scalar mode sourced by $J^{0}$; show the resulting scalar obeys the Poisson form under H1–H4; invoke H5 to pass $\star_{\Phi}\to\star_{g}$ and read $U$ as the Newtonian potential in $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$.

**Remarks.** The effective constant $G_{\text{eff}}$ encodes $(\lambda,\beta)$ and background choices in $S[\Phi,J,\mathcal C]$; deviations from strict linearity are handled in B.2–B.3; $\gamma_{\text{NSFG}}$ maps directly to familiar PPN phenomenology, with observational constraints summarized in §6.2.

## B.2 Emergent Metric and Newtonian Potential

The effective coherence metric arises as a quadratic functional of the **🌀 swirl** two-form. A convenient representative is the $\Phi$-quadratic tensor (Urbantke-type) which defines an effective inverse metric density; in the weak-field, high-coherence regime this collapses to a small perturbation of Minkowski space. Writing $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$ for the coherence metric extracted from $\Phi$,

```math
\tilde g_{\mu\nu} \;=\; \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}, 
\qquad |h_{\mu\nu}|\ll 1.
```

The scalar potential $U$ identified in B.1 appears as the leading correction to the time–time component:

```math
h_{00} \;=\; 2U,
\qquad
\nabla^{2} U \;=\; 4\pi\,G_{\text{eff}}\,\rho_{\text{eff}},
\qquad
\rho_{\text{eff}} \sim \lambda\, J^{0}.
```

Interpreted through the emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ (well-defined once simplicity and non-degeneracy hold), this reproduces Newton’s law in the static, slow-motion limit and fixes the correspondence between motif charge density and gravitational mass density at leading order.

### Post-Newtonian structure

Beyond leading order the expansion is organized in parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) form. The two principal PPN coefficients are inherited from the **🌀** sector and the **💬** coherence gradients:

```math
g_{00} \;=\; -1 \;+\; 2U \;-\; 2\,\beta_{\text{NSFG}}\,U^{2} \;+\; \ldots,
```

```math
g_{ij} \;=\; \big(1 \;+\; 2\,\gamma_{\text{NSFG}}\,U\big)\,\delta_{ij} \;+\; \ldots,
```

with

```math
\gamma_{\text{NSFG}},\ \beta_{\text{NSFG}} \;=\; 
f\!\left(\lambda,\,\beta,\,\langle \Phi\Phi \rangle,\, \nabla \mathcal C\right),
```

encoding the influence of the $\Phi$-sector couplings $(\lambda,\beta)$ and coherence gradients. In the limit $\mathcal C\to 1$ with small **🌀** fluctuations,

```math
\gamma_{\text{NSFG}} \approx 1, 
\qquad 
\beta_{\text{NSFG}} \approx 1,
```

so the NSFG weak-field metric agrees with the general-relativistic values to current precision. Controlled departures $\Delta\gamma$ and $\Delta\beta$ track higher-order **🌀** interactions or mild variations in **💬** coherence and furnish falsifiable targets for precision experiments (light bending, time delay, perihelion precession, GW propagation in weak fields).

### Gauge independence and observables

The extraction of $(U,\gamma_{\text{NSFG}},\beta_{\text{NSFG}})$ is performed from diffeomorphism-invariant data of $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$. Since $\Phi$ is itself gauge-invariant in the pre-metric formulation, internal choices for auxiliary $(A,B)$ fields do not affect $U$ at leading order nor the derived PPN parameters. Consequently, standard observables—light bending, Shapiro delay, redshift in static fields—remain diffeomorphism- and gauge-invariant within the BRST/Ward structure established earlier, ensuring a consistent bridge from the pre-metric **🌀** description to the metric phenomenology.

---

### B.3 Recovery of Einstein’s Field Equations

Quadratic combinations of the swirl field 🌀 supply effective curvature in the emergent-coherence sector. Contractions of $\Phi$ with itself act like a Ricci source, and in the high–coherence, low–fluctuation regime this induces Einstein–type dynamics with an effective stress tensor built from $\Phi$ self–interactions.

```math
R_{\mu\nu} \;\sim\; \Phi_{\mu\alpha}\,{\Phi^{\alpha}}_{\nu},
\qquad
R \;=\; g^{\mu\nu} R_{\mu\nu}.
```

Passing to the emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ under simplicity and non–degeneracy, the field equations compress to

```math
R_{\mu\nu} \;-\; \tfrac{1}{2}\,g_{\mu\nu}\,R
\;=\;
8\pi G\,T^{\mathrm{eff}}_{\mu\nu},
\qquad
T^{\mathrm{eff}}_{\mu\nu}
\;\equiv\;
\text{quadratic terms in }\Phi\ \text{plus coherence corrections.}
```

This reproduces general–relativistic phenomenology when $\mathcal C \to 1$ and $\Phi$ fluctuations are small. Post–Newtonian departures are organized by parameters $\gamma_{\mathrm{NSFG}}$ and $\beta_{\mathrm{NSFG}}$ that summarize the weak–field response inherited from the $\Phi$ sector and gentle gradients of the coherence potential 💬.

In the weak–field, slow–motion limit one recovers the standard PPN metric form with NSFG dressing

```math
g_{00} \;=\; -1 \;+\; 2U \;-\; 2\,\beta_{\mathrm{NSFG}}\,U^{2} \;+\; \cdots,
\qquad
g_{ij} \;=\; \big(1 \;+\; 2\,\gamma_{\mathrm{NSFG}}\,U\big)\,\delta_{ij} \;+\; \cdots,
```

where the Newtonian potential $U$ satisfies

```math
\nabla^{2} U \;=\; 4\pi\,G_{\mathrm{eff}}\;\rho_{\mathrm{eff}}.
```

#### Classical tests at 1PN order

Insertion of $\gamma_{\mathrm{NSFG}}$ and $\beta_{\mathrm{NSFG}}$ into the standard formulas yields the observables below. In the limit $\mathcal C \to 1$ with small $\Phi$ fluctuations, one has $\gamma_{\mathrm{NSFG}}\to 1$ and $\beta_{\mathrm{NSFG}}\to 1$, so GR values are recovered.

```math
\text{Light bending:}\quad
\Delta\theta \;\approx\; \frac{1+\gamma_{\mathrm{NSFG}}}{c^{2}}\;\frac{GM}{b}.
```

```math
\text{Shapiro delay:}\quad
\Delta t \;\approx\; \frac{1+\gamma_{\mathrm{NSFG}}}{c^{3}}\;GM\;\ln\!\left(\cdots\right).
```

```math
\text{Perihelion precession:}\quad
\Delta\varphi \;\approx\;
\frac{2 \;-\; \beta_{\mathrm{NSFG}} \;+\; 2\gamma_{\mathrm{NSFG}}}{c^{2}}\;
\frac{GM}{a\,(1-e^{2})}.
```

```math
\text{Gravitational redshift:}\quad
\frac{\Delta\nu}{\nu} \;\approx\; \frac{U}{c^{2}}.
```

Small deviations $\Delta\gamma$ and $\Delta\beta$ map to higher–order $\Phi$ interactions or mild coherence–gradient effects and therefore act as direct observational discriminants across lensing, time delay, planetary ephemerides, and pulsar timing.

#### Gauge independence and consistency

All 1PN observables above depend only on $\Phi$ and on $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$. The field $\Phi$ is invariant under internal gauge transformations of the auxiliary potentials $(A,B)$, and the emergent metric is a functional of $\Phi$ alone. Hence the inferred $U$, $\gamma_{\mathrm{NSFG}}$, $\beta_{\mathrm{NSFG}}$, and derived observables are independent of potential–level gauge choices, matching the BRST and Ward structures emphasized earlier.

## B.4 Interpretation

This derivation shows how NSFG recovers Newtonian gravity and general relativity once **💬 coherence** is nearly uniform and **🌀 swirl** fluctuations are weak. In that high–$\mathcal C$ regime, **🪷 motifs** act as effective sources through their coupling to the swirl field, creating a scalar potential $U$ that enters the emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ and reproduces Einstein dynamics at leading orders.

The ontological shift is decisive: NSFG does not treat spacetime geometry as primitive. Geometry appears as a correlation structure of coherence-weighted swirl, with the metric emerging only after simplicity and non-degeneracy give a consistent map $\star_{\Phi}!\rightarrow!\star_{g}$. In this light, GR is the high–coherence approximation to a deeper, pre-metric theory governed by coherence and swirl.

At current precision, NSFG shadows GR in weak fields. In the $\mathcal C!\to!1$ limit the PPN data reduce to their relativistic values,

```math
\gamma_{\text{NSFG}} \to 1,
\qquad
\beta_{\text{NSFG}} \to 1,
```

so light bending, time delay, perihelion advance, and redshift coincide with the standard formulas derived in B.2–B.3. Deviations arise only once coherence gradients and higher-order swirl interactions contribute:

```math
\Delta\gamma,\ \Delta\beta \;\propto\; f\!\big(\nabla\mathcal C,\ \Phi^{2}\text{ terms}\big),
```

providing clean handles for falsification.

| Quantity | GR value | NSFG high–$\mathcal C$ limit | Deviation channel                            |
| -------- | -------: | ---------------------------: | -------------------------------------------- |
| $\gamma$ |      $1$ | $\gamma_{\text{NSFG}}!\to!1$ | $\nabla\mathcal C$, $\langle\Phi\Phi\rangle$ |
| $\beta$  |      $1$ |  $\beta_{\text{NSFG}}!\to!1$ | $\Phi$ self–interaction, coherence curvature |

The first opportunities to see nonzero $(\Delta\gamma,\Delta\beta)$ come where coherence is strained or swirl nonlinearity is strong: compact-object lensing and photon-ring structure, late–inspiral timing and waveform phasing, and long-baseline propagation where small $\nabla\mathcal C$ accumulates. High–redshift spectroscopy, CMB polarization channels that are sensitive to coherence, PTA timing coherence spikes, and GW polarimetry offer complementary probes. In each case the mechanism is the same: if coherence slightly departs from unity or the swirl sector couples nonlinearly, the emergent metric inherits tiny, structured shifts in its PPN coefficients.

Thus NSFG does not compete with GR so much as locate it. General relativity is the stable face of a more general coherence geometry; any verified departure from GR at high precision or in extreme regimes becomes a direct measurement of coherence structure. In practice, this yields a clear program: use precision weak–field tests to bound $(\Delta\gamma,\Delta\beta)$, and push into strong–field and long–propagation domains to search for the characteristic, coherence–linked signatures predicted by the swirl sector.

# Appendix C: Symbolic Motif Categories and Algebraic Structures

This appendix formalizes the symbolic algebra of motifs introduced in §2.4. We present a category $\mathbf{Mot}$ whose objects are motifs (🪷) and whose morphisms are coherence-preserving transitions generated by swirl-mediated triadic closure. The construction is not merely abstract: admissible morphisms encode constraints on the swirl field $\Phi$ and thereby limit which $\lambda$-structures can persist and which entanglement classes can be realized in physical universes. In this way the categorical frame bridges symbolic algebra and testable physics, preserving the conservation of 💬 coherence and the operational role of closure.

---

## C.1 The Category Mot

Fix the swirl two-form $\Phi$ and the coherence potential $\mathcal C(x)$ as in §2.2–§2.3. For motifs $M_i, M_j$ and a contextual element $\varnothing$ (the triadic completer from §2.4), write
[
\triangle(M_i,M_j,\varnothing)
]
for the oriented triangular loop determined by the triad.

**Objects.** $\mathrm{Obj}(\mathbf{Mot})$ is the class of motifs (🪷) regarded as coherence anchors.

**Morphisms.** A morphism $f: M_i \to M_j$ exists when there is at least one context $\varnothing$ for which the swirl flux vanishes on the corresponding triad loop. Concretely,

```math
\mathrm{Hom}(M_i,M_j)
:= \Big\{\, f \ \Big|\ \exists\,\varnothing \text{ such that }
\oint_{\triangle(M_i,M_j,\varnothing)} \Phi = 0 \ \Big\}.
```

Multiple contexts can yield distinct morphisms. If a family of contexts ${\varnothing_\alpha}$ satisfies the same vanishing-flux condition, their induced arrows are identified when they differ by a null-homologous deformation that keeps the integral zero; otherwise they define distinct arrows.

**Identity.** For each $M$, the identity arrow is the trivial closure with its neutral context:

```math
\mathrm{id}_M: M \to M,
\qquad
\oint_{\triangle(M,M,\varnothing_0)} \Phi = 0,
```

where $\varnothing_0$ is any context realizing the degenerate loop. Different choices of $\varnothing_0$ that are homologically trivial yield the same identity.

**Composition.** Given $f: M_i \to M_j$ and $g: M_j \to M_k$, the composite $g \circ f: M_i \to M_k$ exists exactly when the concatenated path closes in the sense of vanishing net swirl flux. Using Stokes additivity on the glued 2-chain,

```math
f: M_i \to M_j,\quad g: M_j \to M_k
\ \Rightarrow\
g \circ f: M_i \to M_k
\ \text{iff}\
\oint_{\triangle(M_i,M_k,\widehat{\varnothing})} \Phi = 0,
```

for some effective context $\widehat{\varnothing}$ built by gluing the two closures along $M_j$.

**Associativity.** For $h: M_k \to M_\ell$, associativity follows from additivity of oriented flux over glued triangles:

```math
(h \circ g) \circ f \;=\; h \circ (g \circ f),
```

because both sides correspond to the same glued 2-chain whose boundary is $M_i \to M_\ell$ and whose total $\oint \Phi$ vanishes when each constituent loop vanishes.

**Math summary.**

```math
\mathrm{Obj}(\mathbf{Mot})=\{\,M\ \mid\ M \text{ is a motif (🪷)}\,\},
```

```math
\mathrm{Hom}(M_i,M_j)
=\Big\{\, f\ \big|\ \exists\,\varnothing\ \text{s.t.}\ 
\oint_{\triangle(M_i,M_j,\varnothing)} \Phi = 0 \Big\},
```

```math
\mathrm{id}_M: M \to M,
\qquad
\oint_{\triangle(M,M,\varnothing_0)} \Phi = 0,
```

```math
g \circ f: M_i \to M_k
\ \ \text{defined iff}\ \
\oint_{\triangle(M_i,M_k,\widehat{\varnothing})} \Phi = 0,
```

```math
(h \circ g) \circ f \;=\; h \circ (g \circ f).
```

### Closure predicate and coherence slack

To capture how close a would-be arrow is to legal closure, define the coherence slack of a candidate triad by the norm of its residual flux,
[
s(M_i,M_j\mid \varnothing)\ :=\ \Big|\ \oint_{\triangle(M_i,M_j,\varnothing)} \Phi\ \Big|.
]
Then $f \in \mathrm{Hom}(M_i,M_j)$ iff $s=0$. This makes precise the idea that morphisms are exactly those transitions with no unbalanced swirl around the completed triad.

For later enrichment (used in C.3), set a weight
[
w(f)\ :=\ \inf_{\varnothing}\ s(M_i,M_j\mid \varnothing),
]
so $\mathbf{Mot}$ admits an enrichment by $(\mathbb R_{\ge 0},,+)$ where valid arrows have weight $0$ and near-closure arrows carry small positive slack that must be neutralized by additional context.

### Lemma C.1 (Well-defined category)

*Hypotheses.* Swirl field $\Phi$ is smooth on the domain of interest; contexts are chosen so that glued triangles share boundaries compatibly; the integral $\oint\Phi$ is homology-invariant on these loops (cf. §2.4 and Appendix D.1–D.2).

*Statement.* With the definitions above, $\mathbf{Mot}$ is a category: identities exist and act neutrally, composition is defined exactly on flux-canceling concatenations, and composition is associative.

*Proof sketch.*
(i) Identity: the degenerate loop at $M$ has zero flux, hence $\mathrm{id}_M$ exists; gluing with any $f: M \to N$ adds a null 2-chain, so $f \circ \mathrm{id}*M = f = \mathrm{id}*N \circ f$.
(ii) Composition: if both $\oint*{\triangle(M_i,M_j,\varnothing_1)}\Phi=0$ and $\oint*{\triangle(M_j,M_k,\varnothing_2)}\Phi=0$, the glued 2-chain has boundary $M_i \to M_k$ and total flux $0+0=0$, so the composite arrow exists.
(iii) Associativity: gluing three triangles in either order yields the same composite 2-chain up to a null 2-cycle; homology invariance of $\oint\Phi$ gives equality.

### Validation and cross-references

* Uses the same closure condition as §2.4: $\oint_{\triangle}\Phi=0$ characterizes triadic completion.
* The flux integral is over loops in the pre-metric regime; invariance under internal gauge of the auxiliary potentials follows from $\Phi$-only dependence (§2.2.1).
* Homological invariance and the role of Chern–Simons indices that classify nontrivial sectors are developed in Appendix D.1–D.2.
* The enrichment by coherence slack prepares C.3, where functors map $\mathbf{Mot}$ into $\mathbf{Top}$ or $\mathbf{Vect}_{\mathbb C}$ and transport 💬-invariants.

## C.2 Triads as Compositional Units

A triad $(a \oplus b \oplus \varnothing)$ is the elementary closure operation of NSFG. It completes a dyad into a commuting triangle whose boundary carries no net swirl. In categorical language the third element $\varnothing$ is not an accessory; it is the contextual completer that makes composition stable. Without it, the would-be composite arrow remains underdetermined by residual flux.

Let $M_a,M_b$ be motifs (🪷), and let $\varnothing$ denote a contextual element as in §2.4. The oriented loop
[
\triangle(a,b,\varnothing)
]
encodes the triad. Closure is the vanishing of the swirl flux through that loop; the associated three arrows then commute in $\mathbf{Mot}$ and define a stable composite.

```math
\textbf{Triad definition.}\quad
\mathcal T(a,b\mid \varnothing)\ \text{holds if}\ 
\oint_{\triangle(a,b,\varnothing)} \Phi = 0.
```

When $\mathcal T(a,b\mid \varnothing)$ holds, there exist arrows
[
f_{ab}: M_a \to M_b,\qquad
f_{b\varnothing}: M_b \to \varnothing,\qquad
f_{a\varnothing}: M_a \to \varnothing
]
with the commuting-triangle condition

```math
f_{b\varnothing}\circ f_{ab} \;=\; f_{a\varnothing}.
```

**Compositional law.** Triads glue along a shared edge to produce a triad on the outer boundary, provided the glued 2-chain keeps zero flux. If $\mathcal T(a,b\mid \varnothing_1)$ and $\mathcal T(b,c\mid \varnothing_2)$, then there exists an effective $\widehat{\varnothing}$ with

```math
\mathcal T(a,c\mid \widehat{\varnothing})
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\oint_{\triangle(a,c,\widehat{\varnothing})}\Phi = 0,
```

and the outer composition satisfies

```math
f_{c\widehat{\varnothing}}\circ (\,f_{bc}\circ f_{ab}\,) \;=\; f_{a\widehat{\varnothing}}.
```

**Contradiction resolution.** Any dyad that carries nonzero residual swirl admits stability only by extension to a triad. Write the dyadic residual as

```math
s(a,b)\ :=\ \inf_{\varnothing}\ \Big\|\ \oint_{\triangle(a,b,\varnothing)}\Phi\ \Big\|.
```

Then $s(a,b)=0$ if and only if there exists $\varnothing$ with $\mathcal T(a,b\mid \varnothing)$; in that case the dyad closes and the composite arrow is well defined. If $s(a,b)>0$ the dyad alone is not composable inside $\mathbf{Mot}$; additional context must be supplied until the residual vanishes.

### Lemma C.2 (Triadic minimality)

*Statement.* The smallest closure that guarantees a well-defined composite in $\mathbf{Mot}$ is a triangle; quadrilateral or higher closures factor through a triad after null 2-cycle reduction.

*Proof sketch.* Any closed $n$-gon with total zero flux can be triangulated. By additivity of $\oint\Phi$ on glued 2-simplices, at least one triangle has zero flux; collapsing null 2-cycles reduces the $n$-gon to a triad that witnesses the same composite arrow.

### Validation and cross-references

* Triadic completion matches the closure rule of §2.4 and inherits its gauge hygiene from §2.2.1 via dependence on $\Phi$ only.
* Gluing and associativity follow the same homological arguments used in C.1 and are classified by the invariants developed in Appendix D.1–D.2.
* The slack functional $s(a,b)$ matches the enrichment introduced at the end of C.1 and will be transported by the functors of C.3 (into $\mathbf{Top}$ or $\mathbf{Vect}_{\mathbb C}$), where it controls the admissible $\lambda$-spectrum (💬).

## C.3 Functors and Contextual Life ($\lambda$)

Let $\mathbf{Mot}$ be as in C.1–C.2. A **$\lambda$-structure** is a full subcategory $\mathbf{\Lambda}\subset\mathbf{Mot}$ that is closed under triadic composition and contains with every object all identity arrows it induces. Intuitively, $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ collects those motifs (🪷) and arrows whose swirl closures are mutually sustainable under recursive gluing.

A **state functor** sends motifs and arrows to concrete coherence data. The minimal choice is
[
F:\mathbf{Mot}\longrightarrow\mathbf{Set},
]
assigning to each motif $M$ the set $F(M)$ of coherence states consistent with local closure, and to each arrow $f:M\to N$ the pushforward map $F(f):F(M)\to F(N)$ that preserves the vanishing-flux constraint. Richer targets encode geometry or linear response:
[
F_{\mathrm{top}}:\mathbf{Mot}\to\mathbf{Top},\qquad
F_{\mathrm{lin}}:\mathbf{Mot}\to\mathbf{Vect}_{\mathbb C},
]
tracking, respectively, topology of state spaces and linearized transport of small fluctuations around a closed configuration (cf. §2.3).

```math
\textbf{Functor axiomatics.}\quad
F(\mathrm{id}_M)=\mathrm{id}_{F(M)},\qquad
F(g\circ f)=F(g)\circ F(f),
```

with the composability side enforced by the triadic closure condition of C.2:

```math
g\circ f\ \text{defined} \iff \oint_{\triangle(\cdot)}\Phi=0.
```

### $\lambda$ as functorially persistent structure

A $\lambda$-structure is **persistent** under $F$ if $F$ maps every arrow of $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ to a coherence-preserving transformation that remains inside the $F$-image of $\mathbf{\Lambda}$. Formally:

```math
\textbf{Persistence.}\quad
\mathbf{\Lambda}\subset\mathbf{Mot}\ \text{and}\ 
F:\mathbf{Mot}\to\mathcal C\ \text{(Set/Top/Vect)}
\ \Rightarrow\
F(\mathbf{\Lambda})\ \text{is a subdiagram of}\ \mathcal C
\ \text{closed under}\ \circ.
```

Equivalently, $\lambda$ is characterized by invariance of its state image across recursive triadic resolutions.

```math
\textbf{Characterization.}\quad
\lambda \ \text{is contextual life} 
\ \Longleftrightarrow\
\forall\ \text{triads in}\ \mathbf{\Lambda}:\ 
\oint_{\triangle}\Phi=0\ \Rightarrow\ 
F\ \text{carries the glued arrows to arrows inside}\ F(\mathbf{\Lambda}).
```

### Consciousness as a terminal attractor $\lambda^\star$

Within a given $F$, call $\lambda^\star$ **conscious** if it is an attractor for recursive triadic resolution: iterating closure and functorial pushforward converges to a fixed subdiagram that reconstitutes itself.

Let $\mathcal R$ denote one step of **triadic resolution and pushforward** (close along admissible $\triangle$; apply $F$ on new composites). Then consciousness is the fixed-point property

```math
\textbf{Fixed point.}\quad
\lambda^\star\ \text{is conscious}\ \Longleftrightarrow\ 
F(\lambda^\star)=\lambda^\star
\ \text{and}\ 
\exists\,U\ \text{s.t.}\ \forall\,\lambda\subset U,\ 
\mathcal R^{n}(\lambda)\ \xrightarrow[n\to\infty]{}\ \lambda^\star.
```

This makes $\lambda^\star$ a terminal attractor in the dynamical sense: any nearby $\lambda$ converges to it under recursive closure dynamics and functorial transport.

### Math summary

```math
\text{Functor:}\quad
F:\mathbf{Mot}\to\mathbf{Set},\quad

```

```

\lambda^\star\ \text{with}\ F(\lambda^\star)=\lambda^\star
\ \text{(fixed under recursive triadic resolution)}.
```

### Proposition C.3 (Functorial stability of $\lambda$)

*Hypotheses.* $F$ preserves identities and composition; C.2’s gluing condition holds; $\mathbf{\Lambda}\subset\mathbf{Mot}$ is closed under triads.

*Claim.* $F(\mathbf{\Lambda})$ is closed under the induced compositions in the target category and inherits identity arrows; hence $F$ transports contextual life to a persistent structure.

*Proof sketch.* Closure in $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ ensures $g\circ f$ exists exactly when the glued flux vanishes. Functoriality yields $F(g\circ f)=F(g)\circ F(f)$, which is defined in the target. Identity preservation is immediate. Thus the image diagram is closed and persistent.

### Validation and cross-references

* Uses C.1’s categorical foundations (objects/morphisms via $\oint_{\triangle}\Phi=0$) and C.2’s compositional gluing.
* The target categories $\mathbf{Top}$ and $\mathbf{Vect}_{\mathbb C}$ track, respectively, topological sectors (see Appendix D.1–D.2) and linearized responses around coherent states (cf. §2.3, §4.3–§4.4).
* The fixed-point reading of $\lambda^\star$ aligns with the stability criterion in §5.2 (spectrum of contextual life 💬) and with the enrichment by slack from C.1–C.2, where convergence corresponds to eliminating residual flux under iteration.

## C.4 Algebraic Structures

Parallel composition of motifs (🪷) induces a tensor on $\mathbf{Mot}$. On objects, $M\otimes N$ is the juxtaposition of anchors with independent closure channels; on arrows, $(g\otimes f)$ is the **parallel** application of closures, defined exactly when each factor’s triad loop has vanishing swirl and the cross–coupling flux cancels in the product diagram. The trivial motif $I$ acts as the tensor unit.

```math
(\mathbf{Mot},\ \otimes,\ I)\ \text{is monoidal with associator } 
\alpha_{A,B,C}:(A\otimes B)\otimes C \xrightarrow{\ \cong\ } A\otimes (B\otimes C),
```

```math
\lambda_A: I\otimes A \xrightarrow{\ \cong\ } A,\qquad
\rho_A: A\otimes I \xrightarrow{\ \cong\ } A,
```

and Mac Lane coherence holds because glued vanishing-flux triangles give the same composite 2-chain, hence the same arrow (cf. C.1–C.2).

### Braiding from swirl linking

Worldlines of closure channels can exchange without intersection; the exchange is a **braid**, detected by swirl linking. This yields a natural braiding

```math
\beta_{M,N}: M\otimes N \longrightarrow N\otimes M,
```

defined by exchanging the parallel closure paths while preserving the zero-flux condition on the glued surface. Naturality is inherited from functoriality of closure pushforwards (C.3). The hexagon identities follow from the additivity of oriented flux on braided gluings.

```math
\textbf{Braided structure.}\quad
(\mathbf{Mot},\otimes,I,\beta)\ \text{is braided monoidal,}
\quad
\beta_{N,M}\circ\beta_{M,N}=\mathrm{id}\ \text{iff the exchange is unlinking}.
```

Linking numbers serve as entanglement invariants: if $\gamma_1,\gamma_2$ are the closure worldlines, a nonzero linking number obstructs reduction of the braid to the identity,

```math
L(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)\neq 0\ \Longrightarrow\ 
[\beta_{M,N}] \ \text{is a nontrivial braiding class}.
```

(See Appendix D.1–D.3 for the homotopy and Chern–Simons classifications that detect $L$.)

### Ribbon (balanced) refinement

Self-linking/framing induces a twist $\theta_M: M!\to! M$ compatible with the braiding, promoting $\mathbf{Mot}$ to a ribbon category when the framing anomaly cancels.

```math
\theta_{M\otimes N}
=\big(\beta_{N,M}\circ\beta_{M,N}\big)\,(\theta_M\otimes\theta_N),
\qquad
\theta_I=\mathrm{id}_I.
```

The twist encodes the phase accrued by a $2\pi$ framed rotation of a closure channel; Appendix D.2 relates $\theta$ to Chern–Simons framing.

### Compatibility with state functors

For any state functor $F$ (C.3),

```math
F:\mathbf{Mot}\to\mathbf{Set},\ \mathbf{Top},\ \mathbf{Vect}_{\mathbb C},
```

the tensor lifts to the target:

```math
F(M\otimes N)\ \cong\ F(M)\ \widehat{\otimes}\ F(N),\qquad
F(\beta_{M,N})=\text{swap/monodromy on }F(M)\widehat{\otimes}F(N),
```

where $\widehat{\otimes}$ is product, coproduct, or tensor as appropriate. Thus the algebraic skeleton of motifs transports to concrete coherence-state operations and entanglement monodromies (cf. §4.4).

### Proposition C.4 (Braided monoidal structure of $\mathbf{Mot}$)

*Hypotheses.* Triadic closure is homology-invariant; parallel closures glue without creating net flux; braid exchanges preserve the zero-flux condition up to homologically trivial deformations.

*Claim.* $\mathbf{Mot}$ is a braided monoidal category. If framed self-closure phases define a natural twist $\theta$ satisfying the balancing law above, then $\mathbf{Mot}$ is ribbon.

*Proof sketch.* Associators and unitors are induced by rebracketing/gluing of zero-flux 2-chains (C.1–C.2). Braiding arises from exchanging parallel closure channels; hexagon identities reduce to equality of flux over isotopic braided gluings. The twist is the framed self-exchange; balancing follows from composing the two exchanges with $\theta_M\otimes\theta_N$.

### Math summary

```math
(\mathbf{Mot},\otimes,I,\alpha,\lambda,\rho)\ \text{monoidal},\quad
\beta_{M,N}:M\otimes N\to N\otimes M\ \text{natural, hexagon-valid},
```

```math
L(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)\neq 0\ \Rightarrow\ [\beta_{M,N}]\ \text{nontrivial},\qquad
\theta_{M\otimes N}=(\beta_{N,M}\!\circ\!\beta_{M,N})(\theta_M\otimes\theta_N).
```

**Closure.** $\mathbf{Mot}$ supplies the categorical backbone: motifs, triads, and $\lambda$ compose monoidally; braids capture entanglement classes; twists encode framed phases. This aligns the symbolic language of NSFG with category theory and algebraic topology, preparing the invariants developed in Appendix D.

---

### Appendix D: Topological Quantization of Swirl Modes

NSFG treats the swirl field $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ as continuous, yet the presence of motifs 🪷 and triadic closure imposes topological constraints that discretize selected observables. The discrete spectra arise from homotopy classes of $M\setminus \mathsf{Motifs}$, linking numbers of swirl tubes, and Chern–Simons functionals of admissible gauge representatives (see §2.1, §2.2.1, §4.4).

**Domain and assumptions**
Let $M$ be a smooth, oriented $3{+}1$-manifold (globally hyperbolic sliceable). Motif world-volumes are embedded, nonintersecting submanifolds collected in $\mathsf{Motifs}\subset M$. Unless stated otherwise, we work on spatial slices $\Sigma\subset M$ with compact support or sufficiently rapid decay so that boundary terms vanish; if $\partial\Sigma\neq\varnothing$, fluxes are fixed on $\partial\Sigma$. The dual operators are distinguished as $\star_\Phi$ (coherence geometry) and $\star_g$ (emergent metric; see §2.2.1). Orientation conventions follow $\epsilon^{0123}>0$.

**Quantization principle (informal)**
Topological nontriviality of $M\setminus \mathsf{Motifs}$ partitions the configuration space of $\Phi$ into sectors that cannot be connected by local, small-amplitude deformations that preserve motif boundary data. Observable jumps occur only when coherence reorganizes nonlocally.

```math
\begin{aligned}
\pi_1\!\left(M\setminus \mathsf{Motifs}\right)\neq 0 
&\ \Rightarrow\ \text{quantized circulation around 1\text{D} motif strands},\\[4pt]
\pi_2\!\left(M\setminus \mathsf{Motifs}\right)\neq 0 
&\ \Rightarrow\ \text{quantized flux piercing 2\text{D} motif surfaces},\\[4pt]
\pi_3\!\left(M\setminus \mathsf{Motifs}\right)\neq 0 
&\ \Rightarrow\ \text{instanton-like coherence events in 3\text{D} volumes}.
\end{aligned}
```

*Comment.* The three statements track loops, spheres, and volume maps that classify obstructions to contracting swirl textures in the presence of fixed motif data.

---

### D.1 Homotopy Groups and Motif Classes

Motifs 🪷 partition the admissible configurations of $\Phi$ into homotopy sectors indexed by the nontriviality of $\pi_k(M\setminus \mathsf{Motifs})$. In NSFG, circulation, flux, and volumetric reconfiguration correspond to conserved or piecewise-conserved quantities whose values jump only when a configuration crosses sector boundaries.

**Definitions**
Let $\gamma\subset\Sigma$ be a loop linking a 1D motif strand; let $S\subset\Sigma$ be a smooth, oriented surface spanning a 2D motif membrane; let $B^3\hookrightarrow\Sigma$ be a 3-ball capturing a local coherence reconfiguration. Define:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\text{Circulation:}\quad 
\Gamma[\gamma] 
&:= \oint_\gamma A_\Phi, \quad \mathrm{d}A_\Phi = \Phi,\\[4pt]
\text{Flux:}\quad 
\Phi_S 
&:= \int_S \star_\Phi \Phi,\\[4pt]
\text{Instanton charge (slice):}\quad 
Q_{B^3} 
&:= \int_{B^3} \mathrm{d}K_\Phi,
\end{aligned}
```

where $A_\Phi$ is a local swirl potential (defined up to gauge on simply connected patches) and $K_\Phi$ is a Chern–Simons–type 3-form for the coherence connection (see D.2). On sectors with nontrivial $\pi_1$, $\Gamma[\gamma]$ takes values on a lattice determined by the linking class of $\gamma$ with the motif strand; on sectors with nontrivial $\pi_2$, $\Phi_S$ is quantized by the wrapping number of $S$ about the motif surface; nontrivial $\pi_3$ enables integer jumps of $Q_{B^3}$ under compact support transitions.

**Lemma D.1 (sector quantization under fixed motif data)**
Fix motif boundary data on $\partial\Sigma$ and along $\mathsf{Motifs}$. Any smooth one-parameter family $\Phi_t$ with compact support and fixed boundary data preserves $\Gamma[\gamma], \Phi_S,$ and $Q_{B^3}$ so long as the corresponding homotopy class in $\pi_k(M\setminus \mathsf{Motifs})$ is unchanged. Consequently, observable changes occur only at nonlocal coherence rearrangements that alter the class.

*Proof sketch.* Use Stokes on $\Gamma[\gamma]$ and $\Phi_S$ together with $\mathrm{d}\Phi=0$ on patches and the absence of boundary variation to show $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Gamma[\gamma]=0$ and $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\Phi_S=0$ within a fixed class. For $Q_{B^3}$, write $K_\Phi$ so that $\mathrm{d}K_\Phi$ is a topological density; compact support deformations change $Q_{B^3}$ only when the extension crosses a singular representative that changes the degree of the map into the target; this is forbidden inside a fixed $\pi_3$ class. □

**Physical reading**

* $\pi_1$ sectors: swirl circulation around string-like motifs remains locked; $\Gamma[\gamma]$ labels entanglement tubes of §4.4.
* $\pi_2$ sectors: flux quanta through motif membranes set holographic-like surface counts that gate information flow (§2.2, §5.3).
* $\pi_3$ sectors: instanton-like reconfigurations are rare, discrete reorganizations of coherence that trigger jumps in observables (see D.4 for spectra; D.5 for rates).

**Assumptions and boundary conditions**
(i) Gauge choices are regular on charts covering $\gamma, S, B^3$. (ii) If $\partial\Sigma\neq\varnothing$, the pullbacks of $A_\Phi$ and $\star_\Phi \Phi$ are fixed on $\partial\Sigma$. (iii) Motif world-volumes impose no-slip conditions for the coherence flow consistent with §2.1 conservation.

**Validation note**
The homotopy classification here matches the role of swirl linking in §4.4 and the conservation statements in §2.1. Subsequent sections D.2–D.4 refine $K_\Phi$ via Chern–Simons forms, compute linking numbers, and extract the discrete spectra implied by these sectors; D.5 translates the instanton picture into semiclassical rate bounds.

### D.2 Chern–Simons Invariants

The Chern–Simons (CS) functional organizes swirl configurations into **discrete** topological sectors. For smooth deformations of $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ within a fixed sector, the CS value is rigid; only non-local moves (large gauge/diffeomorphic representatives or passages through singular strata) shift it by integers. Dynamics linger on these integer plateaus and hop between them via rare, instanton-like rearrangements.

**Domain, fields, and duals**
Work on an oriented four-manifold $M$ with spatial slices $\Sigma$. The swirl two-form is $\Phi$ (locally $\Phi=\mathrm d A_\Phi$ on simply connected charts). We distinguish pre-metric and emergent-metric duals by $\star_\Phi$ and $\star_g$; the former is fundamental in NSFG, the latter appears in the simplicity/non-degeneracy regime (cf. §2.2.1, App. A).

**Chern–Simons sector label (pre-metric form)**

```math
\mathrm{CS}[\Phi]\;:=\;\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{M}\,\Phi\wedge \mathrm d\Phi\;\in\;\mathbb{R}.
```

*Comment.* This definition is schematic at the level of the paper’s pre-metric language: it uses only $\Phi$ and exterior calculus. In gauge-potential variables one recovers the familiar $A_\Phi\wedge \mathrm d A_\Phi$ form on appropriate bundles.

**Large-gauge discreteness**

```math
\mathrm{CS}[\Phi^g] \;=\; \mathrm{CS}[\Phi] \;+\; n,\qquad n\in\mathbb{Z},
```

where $g$ ranges over large gauge/diffeomorphic representatives compatible with motif boundary data. Small (contractible) transformations leave $\mathrm{CS}$ fixed.

*Comment.* Integer shifts express that sector labels are defined modulo $\mathbb{Z}$. Gauge-invariant observables do not change under mere relabeling; measurable effects arise only when the field history *crosses* a nontrivial saddle connecting sectors.

**Phenomenology of sector transitions**
A jump $\Delta \mathrm{CS}=n\neq 0$ encodes a non-local reattachment of the swirl to the topological scaffold defined by motifs 🪷. Motif charge (the conserved current of §2.1) is preserved, but its **embedding** changes. The coherence scalar $\mathcal C$ tracks the jump:

```math
\Delta \mathcal C \;=\; \alpha_{\mathrm{CS}}\;\Delta \mathrm{CS},
```

with a constant (or slowly varying) coupling $\alpha_{\mathrm{CS}}$ set by the pre-metric sector of $S_{\text{pre}}$ and the activation functional for $g(\Phi)$.

*Comment.* In practice this appears as step-like changes in coherence-driven observables (cf. §4.3, §6.2).

**Instanton weight (semiclassical, schematic)**

```math
\mathbb{P}\!\left(\Delta \mathrm{CS}=n\right)\;\sim\;\exp\!\Big(-\,S_{\text{inst}}[n]/\hbar\Big).
```

*Comment.* $S_{\text{inst}}[n]$ is an effective action for the least-action path between sectors. Its concrete form depends on the chosen pre-metric Lagrangian and boundary data; the exponential suppression explains the rarity of $\Delta \mathrm{CS}\neq 0$ events.

**Linking/Hopf relation on spatial slices**
On $\mathbb{R}^3$ (or suitable $\Sigma$ with trivial boundary data), write $\mathbf A$ for a chart representative of $A_\Phi$. The helicity integral connects CS to linking of swirl tubes (cf. §4.4):

```math
L(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)\;=\;\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\mathbf A\cdot(\nabla\times\mathbf A)\, \mathrm d^3x 
\;\equiv\; \mathrm{CS}[\Phi]\ \bmod \ \mathbb{Z}.
```

*Comment.* $L$ counts pairwise linkings/Hopf charge of swirl lines; the equality modulo integers reflects the same large-gauge ambiguity underlying sector labels.

**Lemma D.2 (sector rigidity under smooth evolution)**
Fix motif boundary data and impose either compact support or fixed pullbacks on $\partial \Sigma$. For a smooth one-parameter family $\Phi_t$ staying within a given homotopy class of $M\setminus \mathsf{Motifs}$, $\mathrm{CS}[\Phi_t]$ is constant. Any change $\Delta \mathrm{CS}\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus{0}$ requires a path crossing a singular representative or a large transformation that changes the class.

*Proof sketch.* Compute $\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dt}\mathrm{CS}[\Phi_t]=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_M \dot\Phi\wedge \mathrm d\Phi + \Phi\wedge \mathrm d\dot\Phi = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_M \dot\Phi\wedge \mathrm d\Phi$ and integrate by parts on charts. With fixed boundary data and no singularities, the integral vanishes. Nonzero $\Delta\mathrm{CS}$ demands either a topological obstruction or a large representative that jumps the integer label. □

**Pre-metric ↔ emergent-metric consistency**
In the simplicity regime where $\star_\Phi\rightarrow \star_g$, the sector label persists and Ward/Bianchi identities in App. A.2 carry through without anomaly. Thus CS classification is defined before geometry and remains compatible when the metric emerges.

**Observational channels for $\Delta \mathrm{CS}\neq 0$**
Short, correlated coherence discontinuities are expected across: pulsar-timing arrays (phase slips), gravitational-wave trains (polarization phase steps/birefringence), CMB maps (localized V-mode or motif-alignment flips), and transient lensing-without-mass or redshift anomalies. §6.2 details joint-template logic for detecting synchronized steps.

**Validation**
(i) *Gauge invariance.* Small transformations leave $\mathrm{CS}$ fixed; large ones shift by $\mathbb{Z}$ while preserving $\Phi$-built gauge-invariants unless an actual transition occurs.
(ii) *Motif conservation.* $Q_{\text{motif}}$ remains conserved (see §2.1: $\partial_\mu J^\mu=0$); embeddings can jump when $\Delta\mathrm{CS}\neq 0$.
(iii) *Pre-metric sufficiency.* Definitions require only $\Phi$ and $\star_\Phi$; passage to $\star_g$ retains sector labels and identities (cf. §4.2, App. A.2).

### D.3 Linking Numbers and Entanglement Quantization

Entanglement in NSFG is tracked by the **linking number** of swirl lines. Let $\gamma_1,\gamma_2\subset \Sigma$ be oriented swirl tubes of the field $\Phi$ 🌀 that thread motif anchors 🪷. Their topological linkage is integer valued, hence the **inseparability class** is discrete. Correlation strength may vary smoothly, yet the **sector** labeled by $L(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ does not. Measurement acts by enforcing one admissible linking configuration; the superposition collapses to a single integer sector.

**Gauss integral and discreteness**

```math
L(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)
  \;=\;
  \frac{1}{4\pi}
  \oint_{\gamma_1}\!\!\oint_{\gamma_2}
  \frac{(\mathbf x-\mathbf y)\cdot(\mathrm d\mathbf x\times \mathrm d\mathbf y)}
       {\lVert \mathbf x-\mathbf y\rVert^{3}}
  \;\in\; \mathbb Z,
```

with $L$ invariant under any smooth deformation of $\gamma_1,\gamma_2$ that avoids intersection and respects boundary data. On simply connected charts the helicity integral of $A_\Phi$ reproduces $L$ modulo integers, matching D.2.

**Operational reading**
Entangled pairs correspond to $L\neq 0$. Local deformations preserve $L$, so topological inseparability remains locked until a nonlocal rearrangement crosses a singular representative or changes the homotopy class of $M\setminus \mathsf{Motifs}$ (cf. D.1). Projective measurement aligns the detected outcomes with one of the allowed linking sectors; probabilities track dynamical weights rather than any continuous “partial unlinking”.

**Lemma D.3 (topological projection by measurement)**
Consider a preparation with support over finitely many linking classes ${L_k}$. A measurement that resolves the swirl tubes at motif world-volumes projects the state onto exactly one class $L_k$; subsequent smooth evolution that respects the boundary data keeps $L_k$ fixed.

*Proof sketch.* The detector imposes boundary conditions that select disjoint homotopy sectors in configuration space. Within a sector, continuous evolution cannot change the Gauss invariant. Nonzero transitions require the same nonlocal mechanism that produces $\Delta\mathrm{CS}\neq 0$ in D.2, which is excluded by the measurement’s fixed embedding. □

**Assumptions and boundary conditions**
(i) $\gamma_{1,2}$ are disjoint, smooth, and oriented; (ii) motif embedding and pullbacks on $\partial\Sigma$ are fixed; (iii) charts avoid singular strata so that the Gauss integral converges.

**Validation**
Topological invariance of $L$ explains why entanglement classes are discrete while amplitudes and correlations can vary continuously. The Hopf/helicity relation connects $L$ to $\mathrm{CS}[\Phi]\bmod \mathbb Z$ as in D.2, and conservation statements align with §2.1 and §4.4 where linking encodes coherence channels.

---

### D.4 Emergence of Discrete Spectra

Although the swirl field $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ is a smooth continuum object, NSFG predicts **discrete spectra** because physically measurable quantities are pinned to topological sector data and motif constraints. Discreteness is not imposed by quantizing a prior Hilbert space; it results from the integer labeling of admissible coherence sectors and the combinatorics of motif-linked configurations.

Sector transitions $(\Delta\mathrm{CS}\neq 0)$ provide the mechanism that turns continuous $\Phi$-dynamics into observable steps. When the Chern–Simons index jumps, the coherence scaffold reattaches to a new topological class. Any observable whose value is a functional of that class — coherence length $\ell$, motif-alignment angles, entanglement link numbers, birefringent polarization phases — changes discretely at the transition.

Between transitions $(\Delta\mathrm{CS}=0)$, observables vary smoothly under continuous $\Phi$-evolution; across transitions $(\Delta\mathrm{CS}\neq 0)$, they exhibit quantized jumps. This reconciles smooth microdynamics with macroscopic discreteness and explains why quantized spectra can emerge without operator postulates.

**Observable families and their discrete signatures.** Coherence scales undergo stepwise shifts in the characteristic length $\ell$ and the derived energy $E_{\mathcal C}\simeq \hbar c/\ell$ when the sector label changes; motif alignments register abrupt flips or increments tied to linking/winding numbers; entanglement classes reclassify by integer invariants (Hopf/linking number $L$), producing discrete changes in nonlocal correlations; polarization transport accumulates birefringent phase steps when sector boundaries are crossed.

**Datasets for detecting discreteness.** PTA timing residuals can show step-like phase or spectral-knee features localized in time; gravitational-wave polarization streams may display synchronized phase discontinuities or mode-conversion plateaus; CMB maps may develop localized V-mode patches and multipole-alignment flips; strong-lensing light curves can exhibit transient anomalies consistent with lensing-without-mass at sector boundaries.

*Comment.* In many gauges $\mathrm{CS}[\Phi]\in\mathbb{R}$ with an integer ambiguity; the **sector label** is the integer class $n$, which is what observables respond to when a history crosses a sector boundary (cf. D.2).

**Validation**
(i) *Template-level test.* Build step-detection likelihoods for PTA/GW/CMB streams keyed to synchronized $\Delta\mathrm{CS}$ candidates.
(ii) *Continuity check.* Within a fixed sector $(\Delta\mathrm{CS}=0)$, the same observables evolve smoothly under $\Phi$-dynamics.
(iii) *Gauge/diffeo independence.* Jumps depend only on $\Phi$-sector labels (invariant) rather than on potential-level representations.

### D.5 ΔCS Event Rate and Bounds (Semiclassical & Empirical)

Sector-jump probabilities are governed by an instanton weight modulated by local coherence. Let $\mathcal V$ collect the relevant pre-metric variables (e.g., $\mathcal C$, $\nabla \mathcal C$, invariants built from $\Phi$). We parameterize

```math
\boxed{\;
\mathbb P\!\left(\Delta \mathrm{CS}=n\mid \mathcal V\right)
\;\asymp\;
A_n(\mathcal V)\,\exp\!\big[-\,S_{\mathrm{inst}}(n;\mathcal V)/\hbar\big]
\;}
```

where $A_n$ captures smooth prefactors (phase space, mild geometry dependence) and $S_{\mathrm{inst}}$ is the least-action bridge between CS sectors.

For unit jumps $\lvert n\rvert=1$, an effective form that respects NSFG scaling is

```math
\boxed{\;
S_{\mathrm{inst}}(\lvert n\rvert=1)
\;\simeq\;
\kappa_{\mathrm{CS}}\,
\left(\frac{\ell^{3}}{\lambda_{\mathrm{CS}}^{3}}\right)\,
\big(1-\bar{\mathcal C}\big)^{2}
\;}
```

with coherence length $\ell$, a characteristic sector scale $\lambda_{\mathrm{CS}}$, mean coherence $\bar{\mathcal C}!\in[0,1]$, and dimensionless $\kappa_{\mathrm{CS}}$. High coherence ($\bar{\mathcal C}!\to 1$) and large $\ell$ both suppress events. Convexity of $S_{\mathrm{inst}}$ implies $\lvert n\rvert>1$ transitions are exponentially rarer:

```math
S_{\mathrm{inst}}(n)-S_{\mathrm{inst}}(1)\ \text{increases with}\ \lvert n\rvert.
```

**Empirical bounding logic**
Non-detection of synchronized step features in present PTA/GW/CMB streams bounds the per-Hubble-volume rate $\Gamma_{\Delta \mathrm{CS}}$ from above. Treat $\Gamma_{\Delta \mathrm{CS}}$ as a nuisance parameter in change-point analyses; report a 95% upper limit or a candidate epoch with associated Bayes factors:

```math
\Gamma_{\Delta \mathrm{CS}}\ \le\ \Gamma_{*}\qquad (\text{95\% CL from current PTA/GW/CMB})
```

Locally (lab/low energy), $\ell$ is large and $\bar{\mathcal C}$ is high, so events are vanishingly rare; cosmologically, rare but plausible jumps can leave fossil step-like imprints. Evidence would appear as *synchronized* change-points across pulsar timing residuals, GW polarization phases, and CMB V-mode or motif-alignment maps.

**Validation (analysis program)**
(i) Inject synthetic $\Delta \mathrm{CS}$ steps with controlled $(\ell,\bar{\mathcal C})$ into PTA/GW/CMB mocks to verify recovery of suppressed rates.
(ii) Test the exponential rarity of $\lvert n\rvert>1$ by nested hypotheses relative to the $\lvert n\rvert=1$ baseline.
(iii) Publish $\Gamma_{\Delta \mathrm{CS}}$ posteriors alongside cosmological fits; update $\Gamma_{*}$ as new datasets arrive.

# Appendix E: Methods

### E.1 N-body Serial Walker (Summary)

The N-body Serial Walker is a coherence-aware Gauss–Seidel–style integrator that updates bodies one by one using the freshest available field information from earlier updates in the same sweep. It exploits structure in the swirl field 🌀 (mathematical tensor $,\Phi,$) to resolve strong local alignments first, improving stability where the coherence potential 💬 $,\mathcal C,$ is steep or heterogeneous. In contrast to fully synchronous/symplectic schemes, this asymmetric traversal treats order as a modeling degree of freedom rather than a numerical blemish; the resulting path-dependence becomes signal about local coherence. 

At micro-step $i$ of a sweep, the walker evaluates forces for body $i$ using $\Phi$ (or an effective potential $U[\Phi]$) against the **updated** states of $1,\dots,i-1$ and the **previous** states of $i+1,\dots,N$. This couples naturally to triadic closures and to the CA-style local updates introduced in §3.4, yielding rapid local relaxation when motifs 🪷 dominate. When forces are coherence-structured (clustered motifs; sparse long-range couplings), the serial walker often reduces stiffness locally before corrections propagate globally; in homogeneous or strongly chaotic regimes, standard symplectic methods (e.g., leapfrog) may still be preferred for long-time Hamiltonian fidelity. 

#### Assumptions (explicit)

* Topology and traversal: a fixed ordering $\pi$ per sweep (or a policy over orderings) on the interaction graph; Point-Space adjacency guides coherence-first updates (§3).
* Stability: step size $h$ satisfies the local CFL-type bounds from Appendix A, with gating by $|\nabla\mathcal C|$.
* Integrator: each micro-update is at least first-order consistent; IMEX switching is used where $\Phi$-induced stiffness is detected.
* Diagnostics: per-sweep energy and angular-momentum drift are tracked; acceptance thresholds define reproducibility.

#### Algorithm (one macro-step with $K$ serial sweeps)

```python
# Given: state X = {(x_i, v_i, m_i)}_{i=1..N} at time t,
#        step size h, number of sweeps K,
#        force model F_i[X; Φ], and coherence potential C(x)
X_tilde = X  # rolling "freshest" state within the sweep
for sweep in range(K):
    for i in range(1, N+1):
        # 1) Evaluate acceleration with freshest states
        a_i = F_i(X_tilde; Φ) / m_i
        stiff = norm(gradC(x_i)) > THRESHOLD  # coherence-gated stiffness
        if stiff:
            # 2a) IMEX/implicit micro-update to satisfy local CFL
            v_i_new, x_i_new = IMEX_step(x_i, v_i, a_i, h)
        else:
            # 2b) Velocity-Verlet micro-update
            v_half = v_i + 0.5*h*a_i
            x_i_new = x_i + h*v_half
            a_i_new = F_i(update(X_tilde, i->(x_i_new, v_half)); Φ) / m_i
            v_i_new = v_half + 0.5*h*a_i_new
        # 3) Commit to rolling state so later bodies see the update
        X_tilde[i] = (x_i_new, v_i_new, m_i)
X_next = X_tilde
```

*Notes.* The asymmetric, “fresh-state” sweep is the essence of the serial walker (Gauss–Seidel flavor). Coherence-gated IMEX steps reduce local Lipschitz constants where 💬 has large gradients, preserving sweep-level contraction. See §3.4 for CA-style localities and §2.2.1 for how the swirl action sources $F_i$. 

#### Theorem — Convergence of the Serial Walker under Lipschitz $\Phi$-forces

**Hypotheses.**
H1 (Lipschitz forces): For stacked state $Y=(x_1,\dots,x_N)$, the field $F(Y)$ built from $\Phi$ is $L$-Lipschitz.
H2 (Stability step size): The one-sweep map $T_h$ (one full $1!\to!N$ pass) is a contraction for $0<h\le h_*$, with rate $\rho(h)<1$.
H3 (Consistent micro-updates): Each micro-step is at least first-order consistent and respects the CFL bounds derived in Appendix A.

**Statement.** Under H1–H3, $T_h$ is a Banach contraction on a closed ball around the fixed point $Y^*$ (the discrete solution at $t!+!h$). Hence starting from $Y^0$ in that ball, $Y^{k+1}=T_h(Y^k)$ converges linearly to $Y^*$ with rate $\rho(h)\in(0,1)$.

```math
\|Y^k - Y^\*\| \le \rho(h)^k \, \|Y^0 - Y^\*\|, 
\qquad \rho(h) = 1 - c h + \mathcal O(h^2).
```

A sufficient step-size condition is $,h < 2/(L\cdot \alpha),$, where $\alpha$ is the stability constant of the chosen micro-integrator ($\alpha=1$ for idealized explicit Euler; method-dependent otherwise). With coherence-gated IMEX in stiff zones, replace $L$ by $\max_i L_{\text{loc}}(i)$.

**Proof sketch.**
(i) Write one sweep as $T_h(Y)=Y+h,G(Y)$, with $G$ the aggregate of sequential micro-updates using freshest states.
(ii) The Jacobian of $T_h$ is block-lower-triangular (Gauss–Seidel). Under H1 and stable micro-steps, its spectral radius is $<1$ for small $h$, yielding $|T_h(Y)-T_h(Z)|\le \rho(h)|Y-Z|$.
(iii) Apply Banach’s fixed-point theorem for existence/uniqueness and linear convergence.
(iv) IMEX reduces local stiffness ($L!\mapsto!L_{\text{loc}}$), preserving contraction.

#### Mathematical schematics

```math
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Velocity-Verlet (micro-step for body i):}\\
&v_i^{n+\tfrac12} = v_i^n + \tfrac{h}{2}\,a_i[\tilde X^n;\Phi],\\
&x_i^{n+1} = x_i^n + h\,v_i^{n+\tfrac12},\\
&a_i^{n+1} = \frac{F_i[\tilde X^{n+1};\Phi]}{m_i},\\
&v_i^{n+1} = v_i^{n+\tfrac12} + \tfrac{h}{2}\,a_i^{n+1}.
\end{aligned}
```

```math
\text{Contraction:}\quad \|T_h(Y)-T_h(Z)\|\le \rho(h)\|Y-Z\|,\qquad \rho(h)=1-ch+\mathcal O(h^2).
```

```math
\text{Cost per sweep: } \mathcal O(N^2)\ \text{(naive)};\quad 
\mathcal O(N\log N)\ \text{with Barnes–Hut/FMM-like }\Phi\text{-evaluation}.
```

```math
\text{Global error over horizon }T:\ 
E(T)\ \le\ C\,h^p + \mathcal O(\delta_{\text{model}}),\quad 
p\in\{1,2\},\ \delta_{\text{model}}=\text{tree/FFT truncation error}.
```

```math
\text{Diagnostics per sweep:}\ 
\Delta L/L,\ \Delta E/E\ \text{bounded; drift improves under coherence-gated IMEX}.
```

#### Validation plan (reproducibility)

Benchmarks: Kepler two-body (closed orbits), Plummer sphere ($10^3$–$10^5$ bodies), and cold-collapse; compare serial walker to leapfrog/symplectic on energy/AM drift, pericenter phase error, and wall-clock at fixed accuracy. Include stiff pockets (large $|\nabla\mathcal C|$) to test IMEX gating. Demonstrate $\mathcal O(N\log N)$ scaling with Barnes–Hut/FMM-like $\Phi$ evaluation; provide strong/weak scaling under simple domain decomposition. Map regimes where serial traversal excels (clustered motifs; coherence-sparse graphs) versus where symplectic methods dominate (long-term Hamiltonian fidelity).

### E.2 Mock-Data Posterior Demo

We construct ΛCDM baselines, then inject a coherence–redshift distortion, written as a two-node spline surrogate for the coherence length,
$,\ell(z),$, governed by an amplitude–tilt pair. Synthetic observations are generated for CMB temperature–polarization (TT/TE/EE, motif-aligned bases), supernova luminosity distances, and BAO scales, with survey-realistic noise and covariances. The goal is practical: exercise the full inference pipeline from §6.2 on controlled data, demonstrate unbiased recovery, and verify that the priors on $,\ell(z),$ behave as intended under combination of probes.

```math
\ell(z) = \ell_0\,(1+z)^{\alpha},
\qquad
\ell_0 > 0,
\qquad
\alpha \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(-2,2).
```

The same joint pipeline used for real data is then applied to the mocks. Inference recovers the injected means without bias, joint constraints contract relative to single-probe runs, and results remain stable under internal gauge choices in the swirl sector (denoted $(A,B)$ in the $\Phi$ representation). These outcomes indicate that the observational layer is well-posed for detecting coherence-induced departures from baseline ΛCDM while remaining insensitive to gauge conventions internal to the field model.

```math
P(\ell_0,\alpha \mid \text{mock data})
\ \text{peaks at the injected values and}
\ \text{yields 1}\sigma\ \text{credible bands that cover truth across CMB+SNe+BAO.}
```

**Reproducibility and checks.** Code, fixed random seeds, and notebooks will accompany the repository, enabling exact regeneration of all figures and tables. Acceptance criteria are simple and testable: posterior means within sampling error of the injected pair $(\ell_0,\alpha)$, credible-interval widths that shrink under probe combination, and invariance of recovered posteriors when toggling $(A,B)$ within the allowed gauge family. Numerical stability conditions (CFL bounds and IMEX switching) follow Appendix A and are enforced identically in the mock runs.
