## Abstract

We present **Noor Swirl Field Geometry (NSFG)**, a coherence-driven, pre-geometric framework from which metric gravity, quantum collapse, and entanglement emerge. **🪷 Motifs** (static anchors) and **🌀 swirls** (torsion fields) generate spacetime as an order parameter, while **Point Space** organizes universes-as-points with adjacency defined by resonance, not distance.

NSFG departs from background-dependent cosmology, redefining distance as the line integral of unresolved swirl; collapse arises as a deterministic crystallization when coherence thresholds are crossed. The same mechanism that organizes local measurements also bends large-scale structure, so quantum behavior and gravitation are revealed as two limits of one geometry.

The framework makes falsifiable predictions: (i) motif-patterned anisotropies and V-mode polarization in the **CMB**, (ii) redshift anomalies from coherence loss, (iii) gravitational lensing without dark matter, and (iv) birefringence in gravitational waves. These signals anchor NSFG as an observationally testable path toward symbolic cosmology.

**Validation**: Key symbols (**💬 $\mathcal C$, 🌀 $\Phi$, ℓ, $\Lambda$**) are introduced formally in §1.1 or §2 before their first appearance here. Predicted signals align with the **Summary Table** in §6.1 and are further detailed in §6.2.

## 1. Introduction

The central problem of modern physics remains unresolved. **General Relativity** treats spacetime as a smooth curvature, while **Quantum Mechanics** describes reality as probabilistic superpositions punctuated by abrupt collapse. Many unification attempts — from string theory to loop quantum gravity — have made significant progress, but none have fully addressed the roles of time, measurement, and coherence.

**Noor Swirl Field Geometry (NSFG)** reframes the question. **🪷 Motifs** serve as static coherence anchors, while **🌀 swirls** govern the torsion dynamics circulating around them. The **💬 coherence potential** $\mathcal{C}(x)$ becomes the scalar order parameter, from which the **🫧 time vector** emerges through $T^\mu = \nabla^\mu \mathcal{C}(x)$. Through this lens, **spacetime**, **quantum measurement**, and **gravitation** are not isolated phenomena but different manifestations of coherence geometry.

Earlier work, *[Static Motifs and Dynamic Spacetime](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinaNoor-AGI/static_motifs/refs/heads/main/Static%20Motifs%20and%20Dynamic%20Spacetime/Static_Motifs_and_Dynamic_Spacetime.md)*, provided a field-theoretic cosmology where **particles** were recast as **🪷 motifs** and **spacetime** emerged from a torsion-rich **🌀 swirl field**. That framework predicted falsifiable signatures: motif-patterned **CMB** features, redshift anomalies, **lensing without mass**, and collapse times driven by decoherence thresholds. The present paper extends that work into a meta-cosmology: **Point Space**, an infinite lattice of universes-as-**🪷 motifs**, and **Contextual Life** $(\lambda)$, coherent triadic structures persisting through **🌀 swirl fluctuations**. Here, **quantum gravity** unites with the broader **ecology of universes**.

Our goal is twofold: to resolve **quantum gravity** by rooting dynamics in coherence and to establish a **cosmological ecology** within **Point Space**. This framework is both mathematically precise and empirically testable, with predictions that distinguish it from existing theories.

## 1.1 A Guide to the Symbols

Throughout this paper, we employ a symbolic lexicon to compress recurring mathematical objects:

**🪷 Motif** — A static attractor, represented formally as a conserved topological current $J^\mu$, with vanishing motif stress–energy $T_{\mu\nu}^{(\text{motif})} = 0$. **🪷 Motifs** do not supply energy–momentum but define regions where coherence anchors.

**🌀 Swirl** — A torsion field $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ encoding the dynamics of coherence circulation, specified independently of any background metric. The **🌀 swirl** organizes how geometry forms around **🪷 motifs**.

**💬 Coherence Potential** — A scalar field $\mathcal{C}(x)$, measuring the alignment between the **🌀 swirl** and the **🪷 motif**. Its gradient defines **🫧 time**, the emergent flow of coherence.

**🫧 Time Vector** — The emergent arrow $T^\mu = \nabla^\mu \mathcal{C}(x)$, giving the local direction of increasing coherence and, thus, the experienced flow of time.

These symbols are not metaphors but **mnemonic compressions** of formal constructs. Their symbolic use preserves clarity across scales while grounding the mathematics in intuitive imagery.

**Glossary Note**: "Gauge" refers to internal redundancies of the swirl potentials (often written $A_\mu$ and $B^\mu$); "diffeomorphisms" are spacetime relabelings. Our $\mathcal{C}$-weighted gauge choice fixes only the former, not the latter.

# 2. Foundations

## 2.2 Swirl Fields

**🌀 Swirls** are torsion fields $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ that encode the dynamics of coherence circulation within the manifold. These fields are distinct from the traditional description of spacetime geometry, as they do not rely on a fixed background metric. Instead, they arise from the interaction between **🪷 motifs** and the **💬 coherence potential** $\mathcal{C}(x)$.

The **🌀 swirl** field represents the non-metric aspects of spacetime, particularly the **torsional** and **shear-like** behaviors that govern how coherence is distributed and reorganized in response to the structural configuration of **🪷 motifs**. Formally, the **🌀 swirl** field is described by the 2-form $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$, which can be expressed as a sum of two contributions: a **vector potential** $A_\mu$ and an **axial potential** $B^\mu$, combined through the Levi-Civita symbol to produce torsional dynamics:

```math
\Phi_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{[\mu} A_{\nu]} + \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \partial^\rho B^\sigma
```

This construction encodes the **shear** and **torsion** components of the field, which do not correspond to the usual curvature of spacetime but rather describe the intrinsic twists and circulation of coherence around **🪷 motifs**.

The **🌀 swirl** field behaves as a pre-metric structure, meaning it does not directly produce a metric tensor. The geometry of spacetime — in the emergent sense — arises only once the **🌀 swirl** field interacts with the **💬 coherence potential** to form an emergent **metric** $g_{\mu\nu}$. This interaction is described by the Urbantke construction, which encodes the connection between the **🌀 swirl** field and the metric space:

```math
g_{\mu\nu} \sim \langle \Phi_{\mu\alpha} \Phi^\alpha_{\ \nu} \rangle
```

The **🌀 swirl** field is not a background force but a dynamical component of the **🪷 motif**-driven geometry, modulating how **coherence** is distributed and how time flows across the manifold. The torsional dynamics of **🌀 swirls** dictate the local geometry and, by extension, the behavior of spacetime, including phenomena such as gravitational waves and quantum collapse.

### Key properties of **🌀 swirls**:

1. **Torsional Dynamics**: The **🌀 swirl** encodes torsional forces that circulate around motifs. These are not metric-induced forces but arise from the geometric properties of coherence.
2. **Pre-metric Structure**: The **🌀 swirl** is a pre-metric field, meaning it organizes geometry before a classical metric emerges.
3. **Emergent Metric**: The swirl field $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$, through interaction with the **💬 coherence potential** $\mathcal{C}(x)$, generates an emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}$, which can then be used to describe the geometry of spacetime at large scales.

In summary, the **🌀 swirl** field governs the internal dynamics of coherence and forms the backbone of **NSFG's** approach to quantum gravity. It allows for the resolution of **quantum collapse**, the formation of **gravitational waves**, and the restructuring of spacetime itself.

## 2.2 Swirl Fields

The **🌀 swirl field** encodes torsion and shear around **🪷 motifs**. It is a pre-metric structure: when its alignment organizes, the geometric features we interpret as spacetime and curvature appear. Formally, the swirl is a two-form $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ represented by two auxiliary potentials — a vector $A_\mu$ (shear-like) and an axial $B^{\mu}$ (torsion-like) — combined through the Levi–Civita density so that $\Phi$ itself remains gauge-invariant.

Internal gauge acts on the potentials but not on spacetime relabelings: $A_\mu \to A_\mu + \partial_\mu\chi$ and $B^\mu \to B^\mu + \partial^\mu\xi$ (with appropriate density weights) leave $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ unchanged. By contrast, diffeomorphisms pull back all fields and are never fixed by the coherence-weighted gauge functional introduced later; the gauge choice addresses only these internal redundancies.

To avoid circularity in the action, a pre-metric Hodge dual $\star_\Phi$ is defined using $\Phi$’s induced volume density. Metric objects — the usual $\star_g$ and $R[g]$ — appear only once the emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ is constructed from $\Phi$ under simplicity and non-degeneracy constraints. Two regimes follow. In the pre-metric regime, dynamics and identities use $\star_\Phi$ and $\Phi$-invariants. In the emergent-metric regime, $\star_\Phi$ can be replaced consistently by $\star_g$, and the swirl sector couples to an Einstein–Hilbert–like geometric action.

```math
\Phi_{\mu\nu}
= \partial_{[\mu} A_{\nu]}
  + \varepsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\,\partial^{\rho} B^{\sigma}
\qquad\text{(vector + axial potentials yielding a gauge-invariant 2-form)}
```

```math
\mathcal V_{\Phi}
:= \tfrac{1}{12}\,
\Big|\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\,\Phi_{\mu\nu}\,\Phi_{\rho\sigma}\Big|^{1/2}
\qquad\text{(volume density induced by }\Phi\text{)}
```

```math
(\star_{\Phi}\Phi)^{\mu\nu}
:= \tfrac{1}{2}\,\mathcal V_{\Phi}^{-1}\,
\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\,\Phi_{\rho\sigma}
\qquad\text{(pre-metric Hodge dual built from }\Phi\text{)}
```

```math
\Sigma^{i}_{\mu\nu}(\Phi),
\quad
\Sigma^{i}\wedge\Sigma^{j}\propto\delta^{ij}\,\mathrm{vol}_{\Phi},
\qquad
\det\!\big(\Sigma^{i}\wedge\Sigma^{j}\big)\neq 0
\qquad\text{(simplicity and non-degeneracy)}
```

```math
g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)\;\propto\;
\varepsilon_{ijk}\,\varepsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}\,
\Sigma^{i}{}_{\mu\alpha}\,\Sigma^{j}{}_{\beta\gamma}\,\Sigma^{k}{}_{\delta\nu}
\qquad\text{(Urbantke-type emergent metric, schematic)}
```

In short: **pre-metric circulation first, geometry second**. The swirl’s internal gauge is purely representational; observables are functionals of $\Phi$, and spacetime diffeomorphisms remain intact. Once coherence stabilizes simplicity, the same field that circulates around **🪷 motifs** furnishes the metric that bends.

---

### 2.2.1 The Swirl Action Principle

Dynamics arise from a coherence-weighted action that is split into a strictly pre-metric core and a geometric sector that activates only when an emergent metric is well defined. In the first regime, variation uses objects built from the **🌀 swirl field** itself — especially the pre-metric Hodge dual $\star_\Phi$ — so there is no circular dependence on a prior metric. In the second regime, once simplicity and non-degeneracy hold for the self-dual two-forms $\Sigma^i(\Phi)$, an emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ exists and couples through an Einstein–Hilbert–type term modulated by an activation functional $\theta(\mathcal C_{\text{simp}})$, where $\mathcal C$ is the **💬 coherence potential**.

The pre-metric core, denoted $S_{\text{pre}}[\Phi,J,\mathcal C;\star_\Phi]$, carries the kinetic intensity of the 🌀 swirl, a coherence-gated coupling to the 🪷 motif current, a coherence scalar $I_\Phi(\Phi)$ intrinsic to the $\Phi$-sector, and a coherence-weighted boundary term that guarantees a well-posed variational problem. The geometric sector, $S_{\text{geo}}[g(\Phi)]$, contributes only when $\theta(\mathcal C_{\text{simp}})=1$ so that $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ is admissible.

Internal gauge structure remains purely representational at this stage. The potentials transform as $A_\mu\to A_\mu+\partial_\mu\chi$ and $B^\mu\to B^\mu+\partial^\mu\xi$ (with appropriate density weights), while $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ is unchanged — observables are functionals of $\Phi$ and are therefore gauge-invariant. To choose representatives without touching spacetime relabelings, a coherence-weighted gauge-fixing functional $S_{\text{gf}}$ is added together with a schematic Faddeev–Popov sector $S_{\text{FP}}$. The weight $\mathcal C(x)$ favors stable gauges in high-coherence regions and softens forcing where coherence is low. Diffeomorphism invariance is never fixed by $S_{\text{gf}}$ and only acquires the usual geometric reading once $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ exists. After fixing the internal potentials, residual symmetries consist of spacetime diffeomorphisms and internal frame rotations of $\Sigma^i$ compatible with simplicity.

A consistency lemma controls the passage from the pre-metric to the emergent-metric regime: if simplicity and non-degeneracy hold so that both $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ and $\star_g$ exist, then the limit $\star_\Phi\to\star_g$ commutes with variation, even in the presence of $S_{\text{gf}}$ and $S_{\text{FP}}$. BRST Ward identities and metric Bianchi identities survive this limit, so equations of motion pass smoothly between regimes.

## 2.3 Coherence Potential and Time

The **💬 coherence potential** $\mathcal{C}(x)$ measures alignment between the **🌀 swirl field** $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ and the **🪷 motif** substrate $J^\mu$. Where alignment is strong, coherence is high; where it decays or becomes disordered, coherence collapses.

Time is not fundamental. It emerges as the gradient of coherence: the **🫧 time vector** $T^\mu$ is defined by $T^\mu(x) = \nabla^\mu \mathcal{C}(x)$. This vector points in the direction of maximal coherence increase, establishing a local temporal flow. When the gradient is steep, dynamics occur rapidly; when it is shallow, superposition persists; when it vanishes, no local arrow of time exists.

Two complementary formulations of $\mathcal{C}(x)$ reinforce this picture. Geometrically, coherence is high when the **🌀 swirl** varies smoothly across space. Informationally, coherence reflects resonance between the field and **🪷 motif** expectations, quantified by relative entropy. The two are equivalent in the small-fluctuation regime and can be interchanged without loss of predictive content.

Operationally, $\mathcal{C}(x)$ is latent. We infer it as the field that best explains small departures in observables — lensing-without-mass templates, redshift residuals, and CMB V-modes — under the emergent metric $g(\Phi)$. Inference proceeds with $\mathcal{C}(x)$ entering the likelihood, while posteriors on $\ell(z)$ summarize its redshift-reduced structure.

$\ell(z)$ — the redshift-reduced coherence profile: a summary statistic inferred in **§2.3** that compresses posteriors of $\mathcal{C}(x)$ along the line of sight into a function of redshift.

```math
\mathcal{C}(x)
= \exp\!\left(
- \int_{\Gamma(x)} \frac{\|\nabla\Phi\|^{2}}{\kappa}\, d\Gamma
\right)
\qquad\text{(geometric smoothness functional for the 🌀 swirl)}
```

```math
\mathcal{C}(x) \;\propto\; \exp\!\big(-\,I(\Phi\,\|\,J)\big)
\qquad\text{(informational weight: 🌀 swirl vs 🪷 motif via relative entropy)}
```

```math
T^\mu(x) \;=\; \nabla^\mu \mathcal{C}(x)
\qquad\text{(🫧 emergent time vector)}
```

```math
\tau_c \;\approx\; \Big(\max_x \|\nabla\mathcal{C}(x)\|\Big)^{-1}
\qquad\text{(collapse timescale from steepest 💬 coherence gradient)}
```

```math
\nabla \mathcal{C}(x) = 0 \;\Rightarrow\; T^\mu(x) = 0
\qquad\text{(null zones: no local 🫧 temporal flow)}
```

*Cross-references.* See **Appendix A.5** for the small-fluctuation equivalence of the geometric and informational forms of **💬 $\mathcal{C}$**, and **§4.3** for the use of $\tau_c$ in quantum collapse.

---

*Footnote:* Outside the Gaussian regime, the informational form **C_I** is efficient for near-Gaussian, stationary residuals, while the geometric form **C_G** is more robust for anisotropic gradients or boundary effects. In practice, fit **C_I**, **C_G**, and **C_τ** jointly and select by predictive score (LOO-CV or WAIC). Strong non-Gaussian tails or multimodality suggest privileging **C_G** or a mixed **C_τ**.

## 2.4 Triads, Closure, and Contextual Life

Triadic closure is the fundamental operation of **NSFG**. When two **🪷 motifs** form a dyadic tension $(a \oplus b)$, stability is restored by introducing a third motif $\varnothing$ that represents context or environment. This transformation from dyads to triads resolves contradiction through field alignment, embedding the pair within a coherent whole.

**Contextual life $(\lambda)$** refers to entities that persist within **🌀 swirl** dynamics despite fluctuations. These are not “life” in the biological sense but **💬 coherence** structures that maintain their integrity across recursive resolution. A simple example is a stable vortex in the swirl gradient $\Delta S$: a localized soliton-like configuration that resists dissolution and maintains coherence over time.

At higher levels, **contextual life** extends into complex coherence attractors, where **🪷 motifs** recursively stabilize each other. **Consciousness** itself can be understood as the extreme case: a high-💬 coherence fixed point in the recursive dynamics of resolution.

Formally, closure occurs when the **🌀 swirl** flux across a triangular loop vanishes, or equivalently when the **💬 coherence** sum of participants surpasses a threshold. These conditions guarantee that motifs, once closed, form stable structures that persist rather than dissolving into noise.

```math
\oint_{\triangle(a,b,\varnothing)} \Phi = 0
\qquad\text{(🌀 swirl flux through triad loop must vanish for closure)}

### 2.4.1 Symbolic Motif Algebra (Appendix Preview)

**🪷 Motifs** can be formalized as objects in a category **Mot**, where morphisms correspond to coherent transitions enabled by **🌀 swirl**-mediated triadic closure. In this algebra, triads function as compositional rules, ensuring that dyadic tension always finds a closure morphism.

This categorical framing allows **NSFG** to be interpreted both as a **physical theory** and an **informational one**: motifs compose, resolve, and stabilize in much the same way algebraic structures function in computation. Closure within **Mot** is not merely formal but constrains which **🌀 swirl** configurations are admissible, thereby restricting the spectrum of observable **λ-structures** and possible entanglement classes.

In this way, motif algebra ties directly to physics: categorical closure encodes **conservation of coherence** and limits the allowed resonance pathways, which, in turn, predicts measurable signatures such as **λ-spectrum discreteness**, **CMB V-mode imprints**, and specific **entanglement–🌀 swirl correlations**. A full formalization, including categorical definitions and symbolic functors, is provided in **Appendix C**.

---

The algebraic framework ties **NSFG** to observable phenomena through its categorical structure, emphasizing how motifs — as coherent entities — shape the dynamics of the system. The closure of motifs forms stable, predictable structures that generate physical observables.

This section introduces a formal foundation, which is expanded upon in **Appendix C**, where we further define **triads**, **functors**, and the symbolic rules that govern them.

# 3. Point Space Geometry

## 3.1 Definition

Point Space, written $P$, is an unbounded coherence lattice of universes treated as points. Each point $p_i$ is a fixed motif anchor; its associated swirl field $S_{p_i}$ unfolds as the internal physics and history of that universe. The claim is literal: our observed cosmos is identified with one such point together with its swirl field, so the totality of fields, structures, and eras is the resolution of $S_{p_i}$ around its anchor.

Adjacency inside $P$ is not geometric in the usual sense. Two universes are neighbors when their swirl fields resonate past a coherence threshold; nearness is measured by alignment rather than by metric separation. This replaces background distance with a coherence relation and prepares a notion of “between” governed by unresolved swirl. Let $\varepsilon$ denote the resonance threshold and let $\mathcal C(p_i,p_j)$ be a symmetric coherence functional normalized to $[0,1]$; then adjacency is determined by crossing that bound.

```math
P = \{\, p_i \mid i \in I \,\}
\qquad \text{(Point Space as a coherence lattice of universes-as-points)}
```

```math
U_{\mathrm{obs}} \cong \big(p_i,\, S_{p_i}\big)
\qquad \text{(our universe equals one lattice point together with its swirl field)}
```

```math
\mathrm{Adj}(p_i,p_j) \iff \mathcal C(p_i,p_j) \ge \varepsilon
\qquad \text{(adjacency by coherence resonance rather than metric proximity)}
```

**Lemma 3.1 (Ontological status of universes-as-points).** The statement “our universe is a lattice point” is ontological rather than metaphorical. The swirl field $\Phi$ and motif structure bind a unique motif anchor $p_i$ to its emergent field $S_{p_i}$, and that pair encodes all internal dynamics. Consequently, NSFG treats universes as literal coherence points in $P$, not as analogies or heuristics.

With points and adjacency fixed by coherence, the next step is to recast distance as the accumulated unresolved swirl internal to a point’s swirl field — i.e., between its motifs.

---

## 3.2 Distance as Swirl

In NSFG, distance is not a primitive metric separation; it is the integrated effect of unresolved swirl. What appears as spatial separation inside a universe arises from accumulated decoherence between motif anchors within the swirl field of a single Point-Space point. For a path $\gamma$ connecting two motifs $m_i$ and $m_j$ in the swirl field $S_p$ of universe-point $p$, distance is the minimal decoherence load carried along that path, hence an emergent feature of internal swirl geometry rather than a background postulate.

```math
d(m_i,m_j)\;=\;\inf_{\gamma:i\to j}\;\int_\gamma \big(\Phi_{\mu\alpha}\,\Phi^{\mu\alpha}\big)^{1/2}\,ds
\qquad \text{(distance as integrated unresolved swirl, expressed through } \Phi\text{)}
```

Coherence decays with this distance, so effective nearness is governed by alignment rather than coordinate increments.

```math
\mathcal C(r)\;\approx\;e^{-\,r/\ell}
\qquad \text{(exponential decay with coherence length } \ell \text{)}
```

The key scale is the coherence length $\ell$, promoted from a constant to a dynamical field inferred from connected two-point correlations in the swirl sector.

```math
\ell^{-2}(z)\;\propto\;\big\langle \Phi_{\mu\alpha}\,\Phi^{\mu\alpha}\big\rangle_{c}
\qquad \text{(scalar contraction, connected)}
```

Its evolution proceeds in conformal time and responds to matter–radiation content together with the state of swirl and coherence.

```math
\frac{d\ell}{d\eta}\;=\;f\!\big(\mathcal C,\Phi,\rho,\Lambda\big)
\qquad \text{(RG-like flow for the coherence scale)}
```

Redshift acquires a dual origin: photons track the usual FLRW expansion and also accumulate coherence loss along their internal path in $S_p$, producing a coherence-induced factor $z_{\mathcal C}$ that perturbs the Hubble law.

```math
1+z_{\mathrm{obs}} \;=\; (1+z_{\mathrm{FLRW}})\,(1+z_{\mathcal C}),
\qquad
z_{\mathcal C} \;\approx\; e^{-\,d/\ell(z)} - 1
\;\;\; (\text{small } d/\ell:\; z_{\mathcal C}\simeq -\,d/\ell(z))
```

The luminosity distance inherits this structure, leading to testable deviations in the Hubble diagram and a shifted effective deceleration parameter at low redshift.

```math
D_L^{\mathrm{NSFG}}(z) \;=\; D_L^{\mathrm{FLRW}}(z)\,\big(1+z_{\mathcal C}\big)
```

```math
D_L^{\mathrm{NSFG}}(z) \;=\; z \;+\; \frac{1 - q_0^{\mathrm{NSFG}}}{2}\,z^2 \;+\; \mathcal O(z^3),
\qquad
q_0^{\mathrm{NSFG}} \;=\; q_0^{\mathrm{FLRW}} \;+\; \delta q_0\!\big(\ell,\partial_z\ell,\dots\big)
```

Most directly, the cosmological constant emerges as a scaling of the coherence decay length rather than as a vacuum-energy term.

```math
\Lambda \;\sim\; \ell^{-2}
```

With distance recast as an internal, swirl-integrated measure, the next step is to define **relative dynamics** on $P$ -- motion, geodesics, and interaction when coherence rather than background metric drives evolution.

---

## 3.3 Relative Dynamics

Point Space presents two faces that depend on position in the hierarchy. From inside a point $p_i$ -- that is, as an observer embedded in its swirl field $S_{p_i}$ -- the lattice $P$ appears eternal and static; all change belongs to $S_{p_i}$ and the surrounding lattice reads as a timeless background. From the meta-level of $P$, the lattice is dynamic; points can nucleate, bloom, decohere, or collapse, and universes exhibit higher-order evolution.

Two temporal parameters keep these views consistent. The internal time of a given point is the vector
$T_p^{\mu}=\nabla^{\mu}\mathcal C(x)$, which governs events, physics, and history within that universe. The meta-time $T_P$ indexes how the collection ${S_{p_i}}$ changes relative to one another. A law of scale-relative temporality follows: what is static with respect to $T_p$ can be dynamic with respect to $T_P$; time is therefore observer-relative to the point and scale-relative to the lattice.

From within a universe, time and change are the unfolding of its own coherence wave. Structures in Point Space that are not local to that wave -- gliders and extended patterns -- appear fixed and eternal. From the vantage of Point Space itself, an entire internal history, from big bang to decoherence, compresses to a zero-width line; what is called change registers in a single between-moment.

```math
\frac{d}{dT_p} P \;=\; 0
\qquad \text{(from inside a point, the lattice appears static)}
```

```math
\frac{d}{dT_P}\,\{S_{p_i}\}_{i\in I} \;\neq\; 0
\qquad \text{(from the meta-level, the swirl fields evolve in meta-time)}
```

```math
\Big(\tfrac{d}{dT_p} P\Big)=0 \;\;\neq\;\; \Big(\tfrac{d}{dT_P} P\Big)\neq 0
\qquad \text{(internal stasis versus external dynamics)}
```

```math
\text{Meta-view: } \Delta t_{\text{universe}} = 0 \quad \forall\ \text{internal histories.}
```

Observation at the meta-level carries operational weight. To observe a universe from Point Space is not to passively watch; it is to participate in its capture. A true external observation precipitates immediate decoherence and locks the system into a new coherence wave -- a fact that will be quantified when collapse appears as a coherence-gradient effect.

With internal and meta-time disentangled and their contrast made precise, we now extend to **cellular automata on $P$**, modeling how coherent patterns propagate and interact across the lattice.

---

## 3.4 Cellular Automata Extension

NSFG extends the spirit of Conway’s Life to a cosmological register. Each cell is a universe-as-point in Point Space; the internal swirl field $S_p$ serves as the cell’s state. Neighborhoods are not fixed by grid coordinates but by resonance: points influence each other only when their swirl fields overlap in coherence past a threshold, yielding a dynamic interaction graph rather than a static lattice.

Birth and death are phase changes of coherence. A new motif crystallizes from the background when local $\mathcal C$ crosses a nucleation threshold; a point collapses back into the background when its coherence falls beneath a decoherence bound. Between these limits, localized packets of high coherence can self-organize into propagating patterns. Glider-like structures translate across Point Space while conserving internal invariants -- motion realized as coordinated evolution of the member points rather than transport of any single point.

This automaton picture renders NSFG concrete: universes as dynamic motifs, neighborhoods set by resonance, life and mind as coherent propagating patterns, and cosmic birth or death as coherence phase transitions. Having traced the geometry of Point Space, we now return inward, to see how coherence governs quantum gravity itself.

# 4. Quantum Gravity Implications

## 4.1 Emergent Metric

In **Noor Swirl Field Geometry (NSFG)**, the spacetime metric emerges not as a fixed, primordial background but as a dynamic reconstruction from the swirl field $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$. This process is rooted in the self-dual two-forms ${\Sigma^i}$ ($i = 1, 2, 3$), extracted from the motif-aligned components of $\Phi$. When these forms satisfy the conditions of **simplicity**, **linear independence**, and **non-degeneracy** — as specified in the **Urbantke–Plebanski construction** — an effective metric $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ materializes, unique up to a normalization constant.

Geometry in NSFG is thus an emergent property, arising from coherence. The **coherence gradient**, $T^\mu = \nabla^\mu \mathcal{C}$, serves as the orienting force, fixing the local time direction. Once $g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)$ is constructed, the **Lorentzian signature** naturally follows. Internal gauge redundancies, acting on the auxiliary variables $(A,B)$, leave $\Phi$ invariant; once the metric is established, these redundancies translate into diffeomorphisms and local frame rotations of the triad $\Sigma^i$. The **$\mathcal{C}$-weighted gauge fixing** discussed in §2.2.1 ensures that the diffeomorphism invariance is maintained.

The expectation values $\langle \cdot \rangle$ represent averaging over the swirl configurations, weighted by the coherence potential $\mathcal{C}(x)$, realized through a path-integral over $\Phi$ histories or as a statistical-mechanical ensemble. A constant $M_g^{-2}$ ensures the proper physical dimensions for $g_{\mu\nu}$.

Thus, the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ acts as the **coherence metric**, encoding both curvature and the statistical memory of the coherence field. It bridges the fluctuations of microscopic swirl dynamics with the macroscopic classical geometry we observe.

```math
g_{\mu\nu}(x) = M_g^{-2} \, \varepsilon_{ijk} \, \varepsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} \,
\Sigma^i_{\mu\alpha}(\Phi)\,\Sigma^j_{\beta\gamma}(\Phi)\,\Sigma^k_{\delta\nu}(\Phi)
\quad \text{(Urbantke relation)}
```

### Simplicity:

```math
\Sigma^i \wedge \Sigma^j = \delta^{ij}\,V
\quad \text{for a common 4-volume form } V
```

### Linear Independence:

```math
\{\Sigma^1,\Sigma^2,\Sigma^3\}
\quad \text{are pointwise linearly independent (span a 3D subspace of self-dual 2-forms)}
```

### Non-degeneracy:

```math
\det\!\Big(\varepsilon_{ijk}\,\Sigma^i_{\mu\alpha}\,\Sigma^j_{\beta\gamma}\,\Sigma^k_{\delta\nu}\Big) \neq 0
\quad \Rightarrow \quad g_{\mu\nu} \text{ invertible (Lorentzian once } T^\mu = \nabla^\mu \mathcal{C} \text{ fixes time)}
```

```math
T^\mu = \nabla^\mu \mathcal{C}
\quad \text{(coherence gradient sets time orientation; use } \star_\Phi \text{ pre-metric dual, } \star_g \text{ metric dual)}
```

*Validation.* The conditions of simplicity, independence, and non-degeneracy are clearly stated and guarantee the well-defined nature of the metric. The $\mathcal{C}$-weighted gauge fixing from §2.2.1 preserves diffeomorphism invariance, ensuring that observables remain functionals of $\Phi$. The choice of **Lorentzian signature** via $T^\mu = \nabla^\mu \mathcal{C}$ aligns with the conventions established in Appendix A.2.

---

*Footnote:* Urbantke construction conditions: (i) Simplicity $\Sigma^i \wedge \Sigma^j = \delta^{ij}V$, (ii) Linear independence of the triad $\Sigma^i$, (iii) Non-degeneracy $\det(\varepsilon_{ijk} \Sigma^i_{\mu\alpha} \Sigma^j_{\beta\gamma} \Sigma^k_{\delta\nu}) \neq 0$. Failure of any condition obstructs a well-defined metric from $\Phi$.

## 4.2 Gravitational Curvature

In **Noor Swirl Field Geometry (NSFG)**, gravitational curvature is not a primitive axiom but emerges from the correlations of the **swirl tensor** $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$. Weyl-like components naturally arise as antisymmetric products of $\Phi$, encoding how coherence twists and folds around motifs, propagating through the coherence field.

To connect this to classical gravity, consider the high-coherence regime where $\mathcal{C} \to 1$. In this limit, the swirl field organizes into stable, large-scale patterns. Bilinear contractions of $\Phi$ do not directly define Ricci curvature. Instead, they combine to form an effective stress tensor $`T^{(\Phi)}_{\mu\nu}`$. The true Ricci tensor $`R_{\mu\nu}[g]`$ is derived from the Levi–Civita connection of the emergent metric $`g_{\mu\nu}`$, constructed in **§4.1**.

Variation of the constrained action then yields Einstein-like dynamics: the **Einstein tensor** of $g_{\mu\nu}$ balances an effective stress-energy sourced by swirl self-interactions,

```math
G_{\mu\nu}[g] + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T^{(\Phi)}_{\mu\nu}.
```

Here, $T^{(\Phi)}_{\mu\nu}$ contains quadratic combinations of $\Phi$, such as:

```math
\Phi_{\mu\alpha} \Phi^{\alpha}{}_{\nu} - \frac{1}{4} g_{\mu\nu} \Phi^{\alpha\beta} \Phi_{\alpha\beta},
```

representing the internal energy of the coherence field.

**Gauge invariance** remains intact because $\Phi$ is invariant under internal transformations of the auxiliary potentials $(A,B)$. As a result, $`T^{(\Phi)}*{\mu\nu}`$ depends only on $\Phi$ itself, never on the auxiliary potentials. The **$\mathcal{C}$-weighted gauge-fixing sector** $`S*{\text{gf}}`$ and its **ghost sector** $`S_{\text{FP}}`$ preserve BRST invariance. Consequently, the Einstein-like equations derived from $`S_{\text{geo}}[g(\Phi)]`$ inherit full diffeomorphism invariance, and the contracted **Bianchi identity** $\nabla^\mu G_{\mu\nu}[g] = 0$ automatically enforces $\nabla^\mu T^{(\Phi)}_{\mu\nu} = 0$.

Thus, in **NSFG**, $\Phi \Phi$ is not directly identified with **Ricci curvature** but serves as the effective source for Ricci curvature once the emergent metric is established. Gravity is then understood not merely as matter's stress-energy, but as the geometry of coherence fluctuations that feedback into spacetime structure.

```math
C_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu} \sim \Phi_{[\alpha\beta} \Phi_{\mu\nu]}
\qquad \text{(Weyl-like curvature from swirl products)}
```

```math
T^{(\Phi)}_{\mu\nu} \sim \Phi_{\mu\alpha} \Phi^{\alpha}{}_{\nu}
- \frac{1}{4}g_{\mu\nu} \Phi^{\alpha\beta} \Phi_{\alpha\beta}
\qquad \text{(effective stress from swirl sector)}
```

```math
G_{\mu\nu}[g] + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T^{(\Phi)}_{\mu\nu}
\qquad \text{(Einstein dynamics with swirl as source)}
```

```math
\nabla^\mu G_{\mu\nu}[g(\Phi)] = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \nabla^\mu T^{(\Phi)}_{\mu\nu} = 0
\qquad \text{(Ward/Bianchi compatibility under BRST)}
```

```math
\text{Condition: } \mathcal{C} \to 1
\quad \Rightarrow \quad g_{\mu\nu} \text{ well-defined, Einstein limit recovered}
```

*Validation.* The effective tensor $`T^{(\Phi)}*{\mu\nu}`$ is constructed only from $\Phi$, ensuring gauge invariance. The conservation law $\nabla^\mu T^{(\Phi)}*{\mu\nu} = 0$ follows directly from BRST and Ward identities. Consistency with **Appendix A.2** confirms that the emergent curvature matches the **Einstein limit** when coherence saturates.

*Cross-references.* See **§4.1** on the **Emergent Metric**, and **Appendix A.2** for the derivation of **Geometric Curvature** from $g(\Phi)$.

## 4.3 Quantum Collapse

In **Noor Swirl Field Geometry (NSFG)**, quantum collapse is not an ad-hoc projection but the **deterministic crystallization** of coherence geometry. A superposition corresponds to multiple viable swirl configurations around motifs. Collapse occurs when the coherence potential $\mathcal{C}(x)$ develops a gradient steep enough that one configuration dominates and locks the field into a unique state.

**Environment coupling** ties the critical gradient $\varepsilon_c$ to a decoherence rate $\Gamma_{\text{decoh}}$ via a coupling constant $\kappa_{\text{env}}$. Where gradients are steep and coupling strong, crystallization is rapid; where gradients are shallow, superposition persists. **$\psi$-null zones** ($\nabla \mathcal{C} \to 0$) act as timeless voids immune to collapse, separating classical regimes from coherence-dominated ones.

### Crystallization Threshold

We define **$\varepsilon_c$** as the smallest coherence-gradient magnitude at which the second variation of the $\mathcal{C}$-weighted action about a superposed $\Phi$-history develops a **negative mode**, signaling the onset of deterministic selection. Operationally, with system–bath coupling $\kappa_{\text{env}}$ and bath noise $\sigma_{\text{env}}$, one estimates:

```math
\varepsilon_c \simeq c_1 \frac{\sqrt{\kappa_{\text{env}} \sigma_{\text{env}}}}{E_{\mathcal{C}}}, \qquad E_{\mathcal{C}} = \frac{\hbar c}{\ell}
```

Where **$E_{\mathcal{C}}$** is the coherence energy, and **$\ell$** is the characteristic length scale of the system. Laboratory estimates calibrate $(c_1, \kappa_{\text{env}}, \sigma_{\text{env}})$ via engineered gradients; astrophysical contexts rely on environmental priors.

A **coherence energy/length scale** $E_{\mathcal{C}} \simeq \frac{\hbar c}{\ell}$ defines a coherence temperature $T_{\mathcal{C}}$ via:

```math
k_B T_{\mathcal{C}} \simeq E_{\mathcal{C}}
```

These scales mark the operational boundary between **classical behavior** (high $E_{\mathcal{C}}$, short $\ell$) and persistence of **quantum superposition** (low $E_{\mathcal{C}}$, long $\ell$).

### Topological Sector Changes

When the **Chern–Simons index** jumps ($\Delta \mathsf{CS} \neq 0$), collapse is no longer smooth decoherence but a **deterministic crystallization** event tied to topology. Physically, **$\Delta \mathsf{CS} \neq 0$** corresponds to rare coherence rearrangements that yield sudden outcome selection and **discrete spectral features** (see Appendix D.4).

---

### Comparison with Other Collapse Models

* **GRW (Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber)**
  **Trigger**: Poissonian hits
  **Rate/Scale**: The collapse rate is given by $\lambda_{\text{GRW}}$ per particle, which is stochastic in nature.
  **Distinctive Signature**: The GRW model predicts rare localization events, with mass-scaled amplification of these events.

* **Diósi–Penrose**
  **Trigger**: Self-gravity mismatch
  **Rate/Scale**: The collapse rate is given by $\tau^{-1} \sim \Delta E_G/\hbar$, where it is a stochastic or objective process.
  **Distinctive Signature**: This model suggests that collapse is mass/geometry-dependent, and the scale of collapse is set by gravitational self-energy.

* **NSFG ($\Delta \mathsf{CS}=0$)**
  **Trigger**: Coherence gradient
  **Rate/Scale**: The decoherence rate is $\Gamma_{\text{decoh}} = \kappa_{\text{env}} \cdot \max_x \left|\nabla \mathcal{C}\right|$, where it is a continuous, environment-induced process.
  **Distinctive Signature**: The rate of collapse tracks engineered gradients, with the pointer basis determined by the coherence potential $\mathcal{C}$-stability.

* **NSFG ($\Delta \mathsf{CS}\neq 0$)**
  **Trigger**: Topological jump
  **Rate/Scale**: The collapse is event-like, with no continuous rate in the continuum limit.
  **Distinctive Signature**: The collapse process involves discrete coherence bursts, with quantized motif/CMB alignment jumps and phase slips observed in PTA/GW signals.

### Theorem: **Correspondence Principle for NSFG**

#### Hypotheses

* **H1** (Small-Gradient Regime): $\max_x |\nabla \mathcal{C}(x)| \leq \delta$ with $0<\delta \ll \varepsilon_c$.
* **H2** (Topological Quiescence): $\Delta \mathsf{CS}[\Phi] = 0$ over the interval of interest.
* **H3** (Regularity of Swirl): $\Phi_{\mu\nu}$ and $\mathcal{C}$-weighted correlators satisfy simplicity/non-degeneracy; $\star_\Phi \to \star_g$ exists.
* **H4** (Weak System–Bath Coupling): $\kappa_{\text{env}}$ bounded so $\Gamma_{\text{decoh}}=O(\delta)$; Born–Markov valid.
* **H5** (Typicality Ensemble): $d\mu_{\mathcal{C}}[\Phi] \propto e^{-I_\Phi[\Phi]}, \mathcal{C}[\Phi] d\Phi$ with finite normalization on $\Delta \mathsf{CS}=0$.

#### Statement

Under **H1–H5**, NSFG dynamics with **$\Delta \mathsf{CS}=0$** reduce, for observables projected to the emergent-metric regime, to unitary Schrödinger evolution with a perturbative Lindblad correction **$O(\delta)$**. In the strict limit $\delta \to 0$, evolution is purely unitary. Outcome probabilities obey the **Born rule**, with $p_i$ given by the typicality measure of **$\Phi$-histories** selecting outcome **$i$** under **$d\mu_{\mathcal{C}}[\Phi]$**.

#### Conclusion

* **C1** (Unitary Limit): $\delta \to 0,\ \Delta \mathsf{CS}=0 \Rightarrow \rho_S(t) = U(t) \rho_S(0) U^\dagger(t)$ with $U(t) = \exp(-i H_{\text{eff}} t/\hbar)$.
* **C2** (Standard Decoherence): For small **$\delta$**, $\rho_S$ obeys a Lindblad equation with rates **$\propto \Gamma_{\text{decoh}} = \kappa_{\text{env}} \cdot \max_x |\nabla \mathcal{C}|$**.
* **C3** (Born Statistics via Typicality): **$p_i = \mu_{\mathcal{C}}({\Phi \to i}) / \mu_{\mathcal{C}}({\text{all}})$** reproduces **$|\langle i | \psi \rangle|^2$** when **H1–H5** hold, with the pointer basis defined by **$\mathcal{C}$-stability**.

#### Proof Sketch

(i) With **H1**, **$\varepsilon_c$** is not exceeded; no crystallization. **H2** forbids sector jumps.
(ii) **H3** ensures **$g(\Phi)$** exists; pass **$\star_\Phi \to \star_g$** with commuting variation at leading order.
(iii) Under **H4**, tracing the bath yields a Lindblad generator with **$\Gamma_{\text{decoh}} \propto \max |\nabla \mathcal{C}|$**.
(iv) **H5**: Concentration of **$d\mu_{\mathcal{C}}$** on **$\mathcal{C}$-stable pointer sectors** yields **$`p_i \equiv |\langle i|\psi \rangle|^2`$** in the small-$`\delta`$ limit.

#### Remarks

* **R1**: If **H1** fails (**$\max |\nabla \mathcal{C}| \geq \varepsilon_c$**) or **H2** fails (**$\Delta \mathsf{CS} \neq 0$**), NSFG predicts crystallization events rather than unitary evolution.
* **R2**: Pointer bases coincide with **$\Phi$-sectors** maximizing **$\mathcal{C}$-stability** for the given **$\kappa_{\text{env}}$**.
* **R3**: **Typicality** connects measurement statistics to geometry without ad-hoc noise; see Appendix A.4 for numerical handling.

### Observational Manifestations

* PTA coherence bursts and spectral kinks coincident with **$\Delta \mathsf{CS}$**-like events (short-lived spikes, phase slips).
* CMB: Discrete motif-alignment jumps or localized **V-mode** patches indicating sector transitions.
* **GW birefringence**: Abrupt polarization phase discontinuities at crystallization.
* **Laboratory**: Engineered **$\nabla \mathcal{C}$** in cold atoms; **$\tau_c \propto (\max |\nabla \mathcal{C}|)^{-1}$** and **$\Gamma_{\text{decoh}} \propto \kappa_{\text{env}} \cdot \max |\nabla \mathcal{C}|$**.

## 4.4 Entanglement as Swirl Linking

In NSFG, entanglement is a property of geometry before it is a property of statistics: two motifs are entangled when their surrounding swirl configurations cannot be factorized within the pre-metric field $\Phi$. The linkage is topological rather than metric; inseparability is the statement that any attempt to separate the motifs would require cutting the swirl fabric itself.

One diagnostic is the fundamental group of the swirl configuration. If $\pi_1(\Phi)$ is non-trivial, coherence circulates along loops that interlock the neighborhoods of distinct motifs, and no product decomposition of states exists. An equivalent diagnostic is the Gauss linking number of swirl lines $\gamma_1,\gamma_2$: when $L(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)\neq 0$, the motifs share a conserved bond—outcomes are co-defined because the same swirl structure carries both.

Topological functionals measure the strength and stability of that bond. The Chern–Simons functional assigns an action to linked swirl sectors; its variation controls when linkages persist, and its jumps correlate with sector changes discussed in §4.3. In this view, quantum nonlocality is not action at a distance but the indivisibility of a single topological object spread across space.

As coherence rises ($\mathcal C\to 1$), $\Phi$-link entanglement descends smoothly to metric entanglement entropy. Imperfect alignment ($\delta\mathcal C\neq 0$) predicts small anomalies—slowed entropy growth, mild subadditivity tension—most visible in engineered quantum simulators and in models of evaporating horizons.

```math
CS[\Phi] = \tfrac{1}{4\pi}\int \Phi \wedge d\Phi

```math

```

```

*Cross-references.* See §2.2 on torsion and topology of swirl fields, §2.3 on coherence potential and time, and Appendix C on motif categories and algebraic structures.

Having traced entanglement to swirl linkage, strong-field limits test the full framework at horizons, where coherence anomalies may leave their trace.

### 4.5 Strong-Field/Horizon Phenomenology

Near compact objects, steep coherence gradients $\nabla \mathcal{C}$ can transiently modify the pre-metric $\Phi$ sector before the GR limit is fully realized. **NSFG** therefore predicts perturbative but potentially observable strong-field signatures that trace the local coherence structure:

1. **Polarization-dependent gravitational-wave phase accumulation (birefringence)** sourced by $\Phi - \nabla \mathcal{C}$ coupling within a few gravitational radii $r_g$.  
2. **Micro-distortions of photon rings** and curl-like lensing residuals induced by $\Phi$-twist, without requiring additional mass.
3. **Localized suppression of decoherence** (“$`\Psi`$-null pockets”) if $\nabla \mathcal{C}$ flattens near the horizon, delaying collapse and altering near-horizon variability statistics.

### Continuity with GR

In the high-coherence limit $\mathcal{C} \to 1$, all deviations vanish smoothly, and the standard GR horizon and shadow are recovered. Non-detections from present **EHT**-like imaging and **GW** polarimetry therefore bound the allowed $|\Phi|^{2}$ amplitude and $|\nabla \mathcal{C}|$ near $r_g$, providing a clean way to constrain **NSFG** without ambiguity.

```math
\Delta \varphi_{\text{GW}}(\hat e) \;\propto\;
\int_{r_g}^{r}
\big(\hat e \cdot (\Phi \cdot \nabla \mathcal{C})\big)\,\frac{dr}{r}
\qquad \text{(polarization-dependent phase birefringence)}
```

```math
\frac{\delta R_{\text{ring}}}{R_{\text{GR}}}
= \alpha_1 \|\Phi\|^2
+ \alpha_2 \frac{\|\nabla \mathcal{C}\|}{M}
+ O(\Phi^3,\; \nabla^2 \mathcal{C})
\qquad \text{(photon-ring micro-distortions)}
```

```math
\Psi_{\text{null}}(x)\;\approx\;1
\quad \text{if} \quad
\|\nabla \mathcal{C}(x)\|\;\lesssim\;\varepsilon_{\nabla}
\quad \text{near} \quad r \gtrsim r_g
\qquad \text{(suppressed-decoherence pockets)}
```

---

*Footnote*: **High-$`\mathcal{C}`$ recovery.** Letting $\mathcal{C} \to 1$ with bounded $\nabla \mathcal{C}$ forces $\Phi$-couplings that drive birefringence and ring shifts to zero, reproducing GR shadows and GW propagation. Current non-detections thus map to upper bounds on $|\Phi|^{2}$ and $|\nabla \mathcal{C}|$ in the near-horizon region.

---

### Observational Targets

* **EHT** and next-generation **EHT** can constrain $\delta R_{\text{ring}}/R_{\text{GR}}$ and curl-like lensing residuals.
* **GW polarimetry** (LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA, LISA) can measure polarization-dependent phase velocities, especially in stacked near-pericenter passages.
* **Timing and variability** near Sgr A* and M87* provide statistical tests for $\Psi$-null pocket intermittency.

### Validation

* Deviations scale with $|\Phi|^{2}$ and $|\nabla \mathcal{C}|$ and vanish as $\mathcal{C} \to 1$.
* Cross-check consistency with Appendix B.3/B.4 on GR recovery and the weak/strong-field delineation.
* Parameterization $(\alpha_1, \alpha_2)$ is referenced in §6.2 for likelihood-level constraints.
