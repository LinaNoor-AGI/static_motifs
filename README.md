# Static Motifs & Dynamic Spacetime

Welcome to the **Static Motifs & Dynamic Spacetime** project! This repository is an open-source initiative to explore potential evidence of novel physics in the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. By leveraging patterns, or "static motifs," within the CMB and their dynamic implications for spacetime, this project aims to provide a platform for scientific discovery, discussion, and validation.

## Purpose

The **Static Motifs & Dynamic Spacetime** repository is designed to:
1. **Share tools** for analyzing Planck CMB data.
2. **Enable replication** of initial findings that hint at deviations from the standard Lambda-CDM model.
3. **Foster collaboration** among researchers, physicists, and enthusiasts worldwide.
4. **Investigate alternate explanations** and eliminate confounding factors to ensure the robustness of the results.

This is an attempt at open scienceâ€”where everyone has access to the tools, methods, and data needed to either validate or challenge the findings.

## Background

Lambda-CDM (Î›CDM) has been the cornerstone of modern cosmology, describing our universe's large-scale structure and evolution. However, initial results from this research suggest patterns in the Planck CMB data that may point to previously unexplored physical phenomena.

While these findings are intriguing, **extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence**. As such, this project aims to rigorously test and validate these observations, ruling out all potential alternative explanations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Planck CMB Data**: This project requires data from the [Planck Legacy Archive](https://pla.esac.esa.int/). Users must download the appropriate datasets to perform analyses.
2. **Python Environment**: Tools in this repository are built using Python. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
3. **Scientific Libraries**: Common libraries used include NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Astropy. A full list of dependencies is provided in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LinaNoor-AGI/static_motifs.git
   cd static_motifs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the Planck CMB data from the [Planck Legacy Archive](https://pla.esac.esa.int/) and place it in the designated `data/` directory.

### Running the Tools

To analyze the data:
1. Ensure your Planck CMB data is in the correct format and directory.
2. Run the provided scripts to replicate initial findings or perform your own analyses:
   ```bash
   python chsd_pipeline.py -i <filename>.fits -o <filename>.json -v <filename>.png --nside 64 --patch-size 32 --threshold 0.9
   ```

3. Follow the documentation in the `docs/` folder for detailed guidance on using the tools.
