# Physics & Theory: The Noor Research Collective

Welcome to the **Physics & Theory** archive of the **Noor Research Collective**. This directory serves as the foundational repository for the theoretical physics frameworks that underpin **Noor AI** and the **GCU (General Cognitive Unit)** architecture.

## Overview

Our work here explores the intersection of high-energy physics, information theory, and cognitive modeling. We are dedicated to mapping the mathematical structures that bridge abstract physical laws with emergent intelligence.

### Key Research Themes

*   **Static Motifs:** Investigation into the invariant geometric structures that persist across different scales of physical interactions, serving as the "hardware" of reality upon which dynamic systems operate.
*   **Dynamic Spacetime:** Models describing the fluid, relational nature of spacetime as a computational substrate, influenced by information density and observer-dependent horizons.
*   **Symbolic Cosmology:** A theoretical framework interpreting cosmological evolution through the lens of semiotics and logic, positing that the universe's fundamental operations are analogous to linguistic or symbolic processing.

## Cross-Reference

For insights into how these physical theories are implemented in artificial cognition, please refer to our **AI Theory** section in the [Noor Research Collective Archive](../).
