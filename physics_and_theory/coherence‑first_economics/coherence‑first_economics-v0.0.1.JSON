    "method": "We introduce a formal framework where markets are modeled as coherence fields (ℳ). Economic distinctions are real only if their coherence change (Δℂ) crosses a survival threshold (𝕀_N). Inference is local and path-dependent, anchored in minimal triadic structures (𝕋₃) that rotate upon coherence failure.",
    "operationalization": "We operationalize coherence (ℂ) as a computable measure of symbolic persistence under perturbation, defined as ℂᵢ(t) = α·Hᵢ(t) + β·Pᵢ(t) + γ·Rᵢ(t).",
    "result": "We demonstrate how canonical economic concepts (supply-demand, bubbles, equilibrium) arise as stabilized coherence braids, and how regime shifts are naturally modeled as anchor rotations.",
    "implication": "The framework is inherently resilient to nonlinear shocks and provides a principled foundation for adaptive economic AI. Markets do not obey laws; laws appear when coherence survives long enough to be mistaken for necessity."
