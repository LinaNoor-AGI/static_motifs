The implications extend beyond finance to any complex system where meaning and value are recursively constituted. The final lesson is stark: Markets do not obey laws. Laws appear when coherence survives long enough to be mistaken for necessity."

    "content": "We have introduced Coherence-First Economics: an axiomatic framework that derives economic theory from recursive survival dynamics. By operationalizing coherence, instituting a survival threshold, and anchoring inference in rotatable triads, we provide a foundation that naturally encompasses both stable regularities and violent regime shifts. This work offers not just a new model, but a new metaphysics for economics—one built for a world of perpetual adaptation, and one that provides a native logic for the next generation of economic AI."
