  "_abstract": "This document defines a coherence-first framework for economics in which classical economic theory is treated as an emergent surface artifact of deeper recursive coherence dynamics. Instead of assuming global equilibrium laws, this framework derives economic regularities from local survival thresholds, triadic closure, and path-dependent inference. Coherence is defined operationally and computed directly from price series as a measure of symbolic persistence under perturbation. All definitions, mathematics, and procedures are fully self-contained.",
